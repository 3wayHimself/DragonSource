                        As is expected these days, the full details for the device were leaked slightly before the event, and while respectable, are unlikely to set anyones world on fire. As expected, theres a 4.5-inch touchscreen with a 1620 x 1080-pixel resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio.Powering it is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 Octa-core chip, backed up with 3GB of RAM, and a gigantic 3,505mAh battery. This supports Quick Charge 3.0, and is accompanied with something called Boost, which further speeds up the charging process by putting it into battery saving mode. It comes with 32GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card.The KEYone is a distinct and gorgeous device. As BlackBerry focuses more on its major profit centers  namely software and services  its nice to know that the current licensor to the BlackBerry name hasnt forgotten its roots, and can produce a device that makes us drool.

                        All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, and the federal government shouldnt favor one set of companies over another.Therefore, he has advocated returning to a technology-neutral privacy framework for the online world and harmonizing the FCCs privacy rules for broadband providers with the FTCs standards for others in the digital economy.

                         are just a small sample of sites that rely on the service. Todays announcement that it had been leaking sensitive information for several months means its possible, probable even, that youll have a password or two that made its way into the wild.Its outside the grasp of most web users, but for someone used to crafting specific search engine queries to lookfor leaked data, the information is there. Travis Ormandy, the Google employee who discovered the vulnerability, found it precisely this way. [After discovering the data], we figured out how to reproduce the problem. It looked like that if an html page hosted behind CloudFlarehad a specific combination of unbalanced tags, the proxy would intersperse pages of uninitialized memory into the output (kinda like heartbleed, but CloudFlarespecific and worse for reasons Ill explain later).We fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major CloudFlare-hosted sites from other users. Once we understood what we were seeing and the implications, we immediately stopped and contacted CloudFlaresecurity.The number of leaks was relatively small  about .00003% of HTTP requests (according to CloudFlare). The implications, however, are huge. Its now patched, buthackers may still be able to target the compromised sites to further extract sensitive data, or as security researcher  wrote: presence of data in searchable caches might make small-scale exploitation possible. Lackey also mentioned its likely not an end of the world event, as vulnerable data is probably fairly randomly distributed across the internet.If its sound advice youre looking for, its a great time to change any re-used password. The vulnerability is patched, but passwords are now in the wild. Any password you used to access more than one site could open the door for hackers to gain entry using your credentials. Put simply, your leaked OKCupid password could give hackers access to your Google account, or your bank  if they use the same password.

                        itsrolling out an experimental new feature called Outside Your Bubble.A module sits at the bottom of itsnews articles, showing off comments from readers. The comments are curated from social media, and will  so BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith says  bring reader attention to the varied reactions and viewpoints related to that story.In my experience, people understand that other opinions exist, and what the opinions are. What people dont understand is where the opinions come from, and they dont care to find out for themselves. Thats where BuzzFeeds module falls short at best, and contributes to the problem at worst.Internet anonymity goes both ways. Usually we use it to describe trolls who hide behind digital blackout curtains while taunting others. But the opposite is also true: People are more likely to self-righteously dogpile on a random name online than a person they can put a face to and empathize with.Second, authenticate your sources. How does onedetermine whether the person espousing the opinion actually feels that way or is being incendiary?Find sources that have a history of thought-out comments and demonstrate an appreciable consistency of opinion.

                        He suffers from severe cataracts that limit his vision, especially at night. He also has acute separation anxiety  something which is particularly common among Yorkshire Terriers. Short of having him follow me everywhere I go (which, obviously, isnt tenable), theres not a lot you can do about that.The Furbo isnt a flashy-looking device. You could even describe it as plain. Its body is a solid slab of white PVC, save for the parts that house the devices webcam. Its lid  which you lift to load the device with dog treats  is a walnut-colored wood.Ive had the pleasure of playing with the Furbo for over a month now. At first, I was skeptical. While its true that dogs take comfort from the company of their owners, they dont just merely associate it with a voice. For canines, its more visceral, and includes senses like smell and taste. Although the Furbo is a rather ingenious device, its unable to replicate that. And as an owner, the Furbo grants me an immense peace of mind. When my dog starts barking, both myself and my fiance are alerted through the mobile app, which is installed on both of our phones. And when he jumps on the couch (something which he is expressly forbidden to do; Yorkshire Terriers But I also tried it with some Pedigree Cheesy Bites, which are Ripples favorite treat. These are smaller, and are rather oblong. As a result, the Furbo dispensed several at a time, throwing them across the room like buckshot out of a shotgun. In the below picture, you can see a dog treat mid-flight.The makers of the Furbo arent selling a revolutionary new way to look after your dog. Theyre selling confidence. The confidence to ensure that your dog isnt anxious, or unhappy. The confidence that your prize pooch hasnt just pizzled over your rug.

After forcing users off the page, Facebook wont allow them to log back in, giving it the appearance that their account may be in use by another person.
