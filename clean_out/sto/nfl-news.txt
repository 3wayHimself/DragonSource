"We appreciate not just his on-field contributions, but the imprint that his mentality and approach to the game leaves on this team." in the same first round as left tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson in 2006, Mangold held down the fort in the middle of New York's offensive line for 11 seasons, replacing former All-Pro center Kevin Mawae. Mangold was selected to seven Pro Bowls and earned All-Pro honors in 2009 and 2010 when he acted as the backbone of New York's ground-and-pound offense during its championship game runs. Mangold was one of the  as Mangold's replacement; Johnson started eight games in Mangold's absence last year and has been with the team since 2015. At left and right tackle, there are gaping vacancies that will need addressing in the shallow free agency pool and draft class.

Brady now has more titles than any quarterback, and if he continues to thrive in his age-40 season and beyond, it's quite possible he'll retire with every relevant statistical record. Even the biggest Peyton Manning, Johnny Unitas or Joe Montana fan in the room will admit that's tough to beat.in an interview that aired this week. "I have gotten to know him over the years, he is a fantastic guy. He had an incredible MVP season and sitting there 28-3 I think everybody watching and probably at the game was thinking, 'Atlanta is gonna get their ring sized up here pretty soon.' So that was disappointing.

"To look at Keenan, to look at his background, where he came from and what he was able to accomplish, you better believe he can share information to the players in that room on how to be successful in this league. It starts with toughness," Coughlin said. "Now that's not the first thing on most people's lists when it comes to talking about receivers. But you talk about a guy who's tough, he wouldn't miss a practice with a separated shoulder. That's a little bit of something that has to happen. This league can benefit from more of that attitude and this team from that attitude as well.""A lot," Coughlin said. "I don't think you're helping the quarterback at all when you don't rush the football. I think for our team to be successful in this division -- noting that there are teams that'll come in and run the ball and try to hold the ball, keep your offense on the sideline -- we need to be able to do some of that as well."

Harbaugh has continued to win at his alma mater, and this week he reminisced on his San Francisco tenure "I don't think that I was there long enough to be compared with Bill Walsh or Coach Seifert," Harbaugh said. "... Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we did set a record for coaching there the longest under the present ownership. I take pride in that. Maybe there should be an endurance medal, a courage medal for that."
