The mainstream media has predictably claimed there is nothing to investigate right after Project Veritas released <em>hundreds of hours</em> of secretly recorded audio of employee conversations within CNN Atlanta’s newsroom. Though virtually none of the mainstream media could have had enough time to comb through the 119 hours of raw audio footage released Thursday morning to make judgments, that didn’t stop them from concluding there was nothing substantial to be found within the recordings. Several publications, including <em>Politico</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>The New York Daily</em> were quick to leap on the fact that since the footage was from 2009, there was nothing relevant to discover. Consider the following <em>Politico</em> headline, <em>Project Veritas ‘CNN Leaks’ fall flat</em>. “…what O’Keefe released on Thursday landed with a dull thud in the media world,” writes the publication. <em>The Washington Post’s</em> headline was similar with, <em>James O’Keefe’s ‘CNN Leaks’ are totally overrated</em>, stating that the audio is irrelevant because it’s from almost a decade ago. Infowars reporter Millie Weaver discusses developments regarding an ongoing coup against President Donald Trump with renowned code breaker and former intelligence advisor Louis Buff Parry. Weaver and Parry discuss a recent Tucker Carlson interview with former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright who reveals insider information which confirms a rogue group within the U.S. intelligence community is withholding sensitive information from President Trump in what appears to be part of a coup against POTUS to remove him from office. Parry goes over possible ways the Trump administration could stop the coup within the powers allotted to him by way of the Constitution and Executive Orders. Democratic congressman and DNC chair front-runner Keith Ellison once said that “black people don’t live in a democracy” and “don’t have an obligation” to obey the government. Ellison made the comments at a 1992 protest after white police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King. At least <a

Trump blasted the organization in a two-part tweet, saying it couldn’t even stop leakers within its own ranks. As the culture war is about irreconcilable beliefs about God and man, right and wrong, good and evil, and is at root a religious war, it will be with us so long as men are free to act on their beliefs. Yet, given the divisions among us, deeper and wider than ever, it is an open question as to how, and how long, we will endure as one people. After World War II, our judicial dictatorship began a purge of public manifestations of the “Christian nation” that Harry Truman said we were. In 2009, Barack Obama retorted, “We do not consider ourselves to be a Christian nation.” Secularism had been enthroned as our established religion, with only the most feeble of protests. One can only imagine how Iranians or Afghans would deal with unelected judges moving to de-Islamicize their nations. Heads would roll, literally. <a

At this rate, homicides in the city are set to outpace last year’s numbers. Eight people were shot dead on Christmas Day last year. Wednesday’s total missed that by one death. According to <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>, five of the seven murders happened in just a two-hour time span and included “a woman who was eight months pregnant and had already picked out a name for her baby.” More from the report: Homicides had been lagging behind last year, which had been the deadliest in two decades.  But by Wednesday evening, the city had recorded its 99th homicide two days earlier than it did last year, according to Tribune data. Like last year, the Harrison police district on the West Side has seen the most homicides: 16 this year compared to 12 this time last year, according to Tribune data. The Austin district, also on the West Side, is close behind with 11 homicides.  Last year, it wasn&#8217;t even among the top five at this time, Tribune data shows. The next three districts are Ogden on the Near West Side, 10, Englewood on the South Side, 9, and Calumet on the South Side, 6.  The Near North district had no homicides this time last year but has recorded two this year, according to Tribune data. While homicides had been down most of this year, the number of people shot has been higher almost from the beginning.  As of Wednesday evening, at least 495 people had been shot in Chicago, nearly 60 more than this time last year, according to Tribune data. “The department reported 379 shooting incidents this year, compared to 365 this time last year,” the report continued. “ It counted 91 homicides as of Wednesday night, compared to 93 the year before.” To be clear, the <em>Tribune</em> noted that these shootings DO NOT include justified shootings or police-involved shootings. These are criminal shootings — civilians shooting each other. For more details on the shootings, <a

The infamous “Access Hollywood” tape — in which President Donald Trump bragged about grabbing women by the hoo-ha — was an inside job, leaked by an NBC News staffer on Billy Bush’s own “Today” show, multiple sources tell Page Six. “The tape was leaked by the NBC News division, by somebody at the ‘Today’ show,” says one source. “NBC News knew for a while about the existence of the tape. Billy himself had told them about it. People in the news division became frustrated that ‘Access Hollywood’ was taking too long to air it and decided it had to come out.” “Access” had been working on airing a sanitized version of the tape, which revealed Trump’s comments but protected Bush by editing out his. But the full tape, which was leaked to the Washington Post, featured Bush goading the president. The leak got Bush fired from “Today,” which was, according to the source, part of the plan. “The leaked tape served a dual purpose: It helped get Bush out of the way — Matt Lauer didn’t like him and felt he was a liability — and NBC thought it would derail Trump,” says the source. “But all it did was crush Billy, and, ironically, his own network was behind it.” <a

It seems that Streep was quite taken with an embroidered gray silk gown from Karl Lagerfeld’s most recent couture collection for the house. The dress was ordered, with Streep requesting an adjustment to the design — a higher neckline. Done. Such personalization is what couture is all about, along with exquisite execution, and, in the case of Chanel, Lagerfeld’s design brilliance. What more could the world’s greatest living actress want for Hollywood’s biggest night? Turns out, she wants a paycheck. With work on the dress well underway in Chanel’s atelier, word came from Streep’s camp to cease and desist. “I made a sketch, and we started to make the dress,” Lagerfeld told WWD. Days later, a phone call came in from a member of Streep’s camp. “’Don’t continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us,’” Lagerfeld quoted the messenger. Chanel, he noted, has a policy of not paying celebrities to wear its clothes, apparently even those of the “greatest living” ilk. That’s not to say there’s no expense involved, both in terms of valuable hours clocked by the artisans of the atelier and the bottom line. “After we gift her a dress that’s 100,000 euros [$105,000], we found later we had to pay [for her to wear it]. We give them dresses, we make the dresses, but we don’t pay,” Lagerfeld said. <a

Try telling that to a radical liberal who knows no other means of accomplishing anything besides confrontational, and sometimes violent, protest. George Takei, “Sulu” from the original “Star Trek” series, has yet again taken to Twitter to enlighten his 2.19 million followers about the evils of the Trump administration.

Top Republicans are now publicly saying that Obamacare will never be fully repealed. In fact, many Republicans in Congress are already using the term “repair” instead of “repeal” to describe what is going to happen to Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Without a doubt, the Republicans in Congress are eventually going to do <strong>something</strong>, but strategists in both parties are now suggesting that most of the key elements of Obamacare are going to remain once everything is all said and done. It will be put into a more “conservative” package, but it will still be Obamacare. On Thursday, former House Speaker John Boehner made headlines all over the country when he said that a complete repeal of Obamacare is <a

Instead, Boehner said that Republicans are going to “fix Obamacare” and that they will “put a more conservative box around it” in order to keep their constituents happy.

I’m not saying immigration is only bad, but a lot of problems come with poor immigration policy, as consequences we get violence, terror and gangs,” Zografos wrote. The journalist further called out the European press for ignoring, or attempting to downplay the “enormous problems that comes from liberal immigration policies.” “There is this fear for journalists to not report the basic truth &#8211; which is that Europe has enormous problems that comes from liberal immigration politics, and as we also now can see in Sweden, but also here in Norway.” Many on social media were stunned the leftist site had the nerve to publish the article at all. &mdash; Jose Colque (@DrJhopheon) <a

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has now demanded that the Portland Police Department stop using riot gear in response to protests and potential riots. Sarah Armstrong, spokeswoman for the ACLU of Oregon, said that when police show up in riot gear, it escalates the situation and that police policies should aim for de-escalation, according to <a

On Monday, 13 people were arrested by Portland Police Officers after blocking traffic during a “Not My President’s Day” rally, which was held in front of the downtown Federal building. Six activists were arrested for Disorderly Conduct, three teenagers received traffic citations, and one protester was arrested for Second-Degree Disorderly Conduct, Resisting Arrest and Furnishing False Information to Police. The protesters did not get a required permit and that activists blocked traffic at two highways that ran through the city as well as SW 3rd Avenue and Madison Street, according to <a

At Monday’s protest, Portland Police Officers first rode bicycles into the area and asked protesters to clear the streets.  Those verbal warnings were given for about 20 minutes.  When the criminals refused to stop impeding traffic, Portland Police Officers in riot helmets moved in to disperse them. <a

Kelly signed two memos Monday that made significant changes to the nation’s immigration policy. They ordered the immediate construction of a border wall, expanded the amount of local police who will enforce immigration law, and put every illegal immigrant — excluding those protected under President Obama’s executive amnesty — at risk of deportation. Condemnation of the plan by pro-immigration activists and Democratic politicians was swift. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement Tuesday, “By targeting those without serious convictions, those who have merely been charged with offenses, or those recent arrivals — including unaccompanied children — who have posed no safety threat to our neighborhoods, the President has chosen the politics of division over our nation’s safety.” The policy director of the Center for Immigration Studies Jessica Vaughan, who advocates for reduced immigration, on the other hand told <a

On Wednesday, Julie Tarallo, a spokeswoman for McCain, confirmed that he’d made the trip, calling it a “<em>valuable opportunity to assess dynamic conditions on the ground in Syria and Iraq.</em>” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that he wants to see &#8220;very significant&#8221; tax reform passed before Congress&#8217; August recess, in what could prove a tough task as lawmakers work through a complex agenda. &#8220;We want to get this done by the August recess. We&#8217;ve been working closely with the leadership in the House and the Senate and we&#8217;re looking at a combined plan,&#8221; he told CNBC in his first television interview since assuming office. President Donald Trump has repeatedly made pledges for tax reform and regulatory cuts since he took office, creating optimism among business executives and investors. Congress is expected to introduce legislation next month to at least partially repeal the Affordable Care Act — Obamacare — before it moves on to tax reform. Mnuchin said the White House and both chambers of Congress &#8220;are all working together&#8221; on the tax plan. <a

Keith Ellison, a top candidate to take over as chair of the Democratic National Committee, called Wednesday for an impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump. “I think that Donald Trump has already done a number of things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment,” Ellison said during a debate on CNN on Wednesday with his fellow DNC chair hopefuls. The left-wing Ellison, who is one of the top contenders for DNC chair, argued that Trump was in violation of the emoluments clause, a constitutional clause which prohibits presidents from receiving payment from foreign governments. Some Trump opponents have claimed that the Republican is in violation of the federal law because Trump hotels have received payment from foreign dignitaries. Ellison joins a small group of Democratic lawmakers who have said impeaching Trump is on the table. California Rep. Maxine Waters, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin and Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro have all said the Republican should be impeached. Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, has pushed back on the idea. <a

During a Friday appearance before Families USA — the activist group fighting the repeal of Obamacare — Pelosi was seen repeating words, telling the audience when to clap and mistakingly said John Kasich was the governor of Illinois. Pelosi began by thanking the person who introduced her for his “recanting of what happened at the time” Democrats and activist groups rammed through Obamacare. She recalled telling her fellow Democrats that the Affordable Care Act was going to be a major achievement for government programs, and “stand there with Social Security and Medicare and Medicare,” apparently meaning to say “Medicaid.” She attempted to butter up the audience by heaping praise on Families USA. After attendees didn’t clap after she congratulated them for her work, she said, “When I said we could not have done it without Families USA, that is an applause line for you.” Swedish police have released a statement saying they discovered a hand grenade at a public park in the troubled migrant-populated city of Malmo. The police in Malmo are no strangers to dangerous weapons. The suburb of Rosengard is considered one of the most dangerous no-go areas in all of Sweden along with the Stockholm suburbs of Rinkeby and Husby. Police said late Wednesday morning that they had discovered a cache of weapons that included a live hand grenade in a press release. The items were found in the Pildamma park in the Kronoborg area close to the Malmo Stadium which is the home of football team IFK Malmo. Police say that the hand grenade was discovered and the bomb squad was called in shortly after. <br

When the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl suffered a catastrophic meltdown in April of 1986, it took three days before the Soviet authorities admitted to what happened. And even then, it was a vague report that failed to explain the gravity of the situation. Three days of radioactive fallout spreading across the continent before Europe’s darkest fears were confirmed. And afraid they were, since countries like Norway had already measured heightened radiation levels. They knew something was up, and that the Soviets weren’t being honest. Perhaps that’s why the press in Europe is raising the alarm <a
href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/radiation-europe-russian-missile-strike-radioactive-material-france-norway-iodine-131-irsn-a7591886.html">on a recent spike in radiation that has been measured all over Europe</a>. Though an unreported nuclear meltdown is out of the question, the radiation has been spreading in a similar pattern, beginning in Norway and working its way down through Western Europe, and once again raising suspicious glances towards Russia. The Chicago public school system has decided to openly defy the president of the United States. More than 392,000 students attend public schools in Chicago, and on Tuesday a letter was sent home with each of those students telling their parents that Chicago schools will not “assist in the enforcement of federal civil immigration law”.  In fact, the letter actually says that federal officials will not even be allowed “to access CPS facilities”. In essence, every Chicago public school has now officially been declared to be a “sanctuary” for illegal immigrants. If you would like to see the original document, you can do so <a
title="right here" href="http://imgur.com/a/P3ffm" target="_blank">right here</a>. This is just another example of how deeply divided we are as a nation. The entire public school system of one of our largest cities is now in open rebellion against the president, and that is a very dangerous sign. <img
src="http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Chicago-Public-Schools-460x437.png" alt="null" /> Of course Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had already established a precedent earlier this year when he pledged to defy Donald Trump and to continue to keep Chicago as a “sanctuary city” for illegal immigrants. The following comes from <a
title="the Chicago Tribune" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-rahm-emanuel-donald-trump-chicago-sanctuary-cities-met-0126-20170125-story.html" target="_blank">the Chicago Tribune</a>… As President <a
id="PEBSL000163" title="Donald Trump" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/donald-trump-PEBSL000163-topic.html" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> signed an executive order Wednesday to cut off some federal funding from sanctuary cities, Mayor <a
id="PEPLT000007532" title="Rahm Emanuel" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/rahm-emanuel-PEPLT000007532-topic.html" target="_blank">Rahm Emanuel</a> vowed Chicago would remain one and continue to protect immigrants from deportation. “We’re gonna stay a sanctuary city,”</strong> Emanuel said in a news conference after Wednesday’s City Council meeting. “There is no stranger among us. We welcome people, whether you’re from Poland or Pakistan, whether you’re from Ireland or India or Israel and whether you’re from Mexico or Moldova, where my grandfather came from, you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American Dream.” Emanuel makes it sound like you are “anti-immigrant” if you are against sanctuary cities. But that is not accurate at all. The truth is that America was built by immigrants, but for years we have had an immigration policy that is completely upside down. We have allowed millions upon millions of people to pour across our borders illegally, but meanwhile we have made legal immigration a complete nightmare. I am familiar with the process that someone has to go through to legally immigrate to this country, and it is exceedingly complex and very expensive. So we are keeping out the hard working, law abiding people that we should want to come here, but we have been keeping the back door wide open for criminals, gang members and those that are seeking to take advantage of the system. What kind of sense does that make? And the truth is that the Trump administration does not even want to deport all illegal immigrants. At this point, they are only focusing on those that have done something wrong, and that is very similar to the approach that was implemented under the Obama administration. The following comes from <a
title="the Los Angeles Times" href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-immigration-explained-20170222-story.html" target="_blank">the Los Angeles Times</a>… Immigration officers were directed to focus first on deporting convicted criminals or those charged with crimes. But Kelly also freed them to conduct more raids in immigrant communities and detain people who don’t have criminal convictions. In addition to deporting those convicted of crimes, immigration officials <a
title="will also target" href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-deportations-20170204-story.html" target="_blank">will also target</a>: Unfortunately, if you speak out against illegal immigration these days, <a

This is becoming one of the most hotly contested political issues in the nation, and as we have already seen there are a lot of leftists that are not afraid to openly defy the federal government. Of course the truth is that it is already probably too late to try to turn things around. It has been estimated that there are well over 100,000 gang members in the city of Chicago alone, and a very large percentage of them are illegal immigrants. Someday when things get really bad in this country, gang violence will help fuel tremendous civil unrest all across the United States. The coming civil unrest is a major theme <a
title="in my novel" href="http://amzn.to/2m9jp5e" target="_blank">in my novel</a>, and it is one of the reasons why so many concerned Americans have been moving away from the big urban centers. And it isn’t just leftists that are openly defying Trump. This week, <a
title="it is being reported" href="http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/mexico-says-no-to-trumps-new-deportation-rules" target="_blank">it is being reported</a> that Mexico “will vigorously fight U.S. mass deportations of undocumented immigrants”… Mexico will vigorously fight U.S. mass deportations of undocumented immigrants back to Mexico and refuse to accept any non-Mexicans expelled across the border, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray vowed Wednesday. A day after the Trump administration unveiled tough new guidelines for enforcing immigration laws, Videgaray said the treatment of Mexican migrants in the United States would top his country’s agenda when President Enrique Peña Nieto meets Thursday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Relations between the United States and Mexico are already the worst that they have been in my entire lifetime, and they could potentially get a whole lot worse in the months ahead. When it comes to immigration, Donald Trump is trying to do things very differently from how Barack Obama was doing them, and that is causing a lot of chaos, pain and confusion. We always need to remember that every single person on this planet is of extraordinary value no matter what they look like or where they are from. And we will always need people to immigrate to this country. It is just that we need to make sure that everyone comes in through the front door instead of sneaking through a back door that has been purposely left wide open by careless politicians. A few weeks ago, I observed that Barack Obama’s iconic status as the first African-American U.S. President should not obscure his mixed political record. For that, I was accused by one Radio 4 commentator of peddling a ‘racist narrative’. As a black man and former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, you might think I would be surprised to face a charge of racism — but I was not. For at a time when this country is crying out for frank discussion on issues such as race and sexuality, debate is being closed down because those who find offence in every-thing cry ‘racist’ or ‘sexist’. The result — as I argue tonight in a TV programme — is that our political and cultural elite seem unable to speak plainly about things that concern many citizens. While our rulers seem to have all the time in the world to debate who should use which lavatory (in deference to the transgender lobby), they dismiss anxieties about overcrowded schools or doctors’ surgeries as merely a bigoted dislike of migrants. How has this come about? Forty years ago, ‘identity’ politics was about trying to end discrimination. It led to revolutionary legislation on gender, disability and race. But recently the recognition of diversity has grown into a cancerous cultural tyranny that blocks open debate. In higher education, it has spread like wildfire. <a

NASA&#8217;s Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star. Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone. “This discovery could be a significant piece in the puzzle of finding habitable environments, places that are conducive to life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “Answering the question ‘are we alone’ is a top science priority and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal.” <iframe

The report, which was obtained by German tabloid <i>Bild</i>, claims that there are at least 5.95 million migrants in countries around the Mediterranean who are seeking to enter Europe. In Turkey alone, the report estimates there to be 2.93 million migrants who have set their sights on the benefits of being an asylum seeker in a western European country like Germany <em>OE24</em> <a

Libya, according to the report, is presently home to 1.2 million migrants who want to get to Europe. Last year a record-breaking number of migrants crossed the sea to Europe with most of them arriving in Italy. The Italian government has vowed to crack down on illegal migration this year, but the country has seen little slowdown in the number of migrants arriving so far. Jordan, which has taken in a large amount of Syrians fleeing the civil war, is also mentioned in the report. The German security services estimate there could be up to 720,000 migrants in Jordan who want to come to Europe. <iframe

The attack happened on a subway train at Sankt Eriksplan station in Stockholm, where emergency services rushed to the scene. One passenger onboard said commuters were left in a state of panic, most suffering from breathing problems and others desperately rushing for the exits. Reports initially stated the man threw a rucksack into the carriage, but Swedish police have confirmed it was a noxious liquid instead – the motives behind the incident or the identity of the man involved are not yet known. <iframe

And at the mountaintop of her basketball career, her sexuality marred the moment. There is a “very, very harmful” culture running throughout the WNBA, she says, which saw her get bullied during her eight-year career because she is heterosexual. Wiggins, who last played in the league in 2015, said she retired prematurely to leave a league that she estimated — wildly — is 98 percent lesbian, and which is played in such isolation that it weighs on the people on the court. “It wasn’t like my dreams came true in the WNBA. It was quite the opposite,” Wiggins said <a

It was a depressing state in the WNBA. It’s not watched. Our value is diminished. It can be quite hard. I didn’t like the culture inside the WNBA, and without revealing too much, it was toxic for me. … My spirit was being broken.” <a

The footage could come as early as Thursday, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity during a radio interview. The footage was provided to him, O’Keefe said, by people inside the network. After the radio interview was recorded, HuffPost asked if O’Keefe would be releasing footage from multiple newsrooms or just one. “One corporation, multiple newsrooms,” he said. O’Keefe wouldn’t divulge which particular network would be hit, but said it was one President Donald Trump has spent much time talking about recently. “It’s the one he’s always targeting,” O’Keefe said. That would seem to suggest CNN. Trump has been on a tear against the network since it revealed the existence of an allegedly embarrassing dossier that intelligence agencies were investigating. <a

In the wake of that firestorm, the gay libertarian gadfly Milo posted statements unequivocally denouncing pedophilia and apologizing for treating the subject flippantly. Nonetheless, his lucrative Simon &amp; Schuster book deal was yanked and he was disinvited from CPAC, where he was to be the keynote speaker. In his article, Pruden approves of the disinvitation, saying &#8220;not all publicity is good publicity,&#8221; and disapproves of Milo&#8217;s &#8220;&#8216;gift&#8217; for saying outrageous things.&#8221; He concludes the piece by saying, &#8220;The moral here for conservatives is that just because someone calls himself a conservative, claiming he is heir to carefully nourished values formed and defended by the generations, does not mean that he is one.” A shocking new Harvard-Harris poll shows 80% of voters are opposed to sanctuary cities and 75% want increased border patrols. The majority of voters also support Trump&#8217;s travel ban and are opposed to bringing in so many refugees. President Trump tweeted the poll out this afternoon: From <a
href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/320487-poll-americans-overwhelmingly-oppose-sanctuary-cities">The Hill</a>: An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to federal authorities. The poll shows that President Trump has broad public support in his effort to crack down on sanctuary cities. A survey from Harvard&#8211;Harris Poll provided exclusively to The Hill found that 80 percent of voters say local authorities should have to comply with the law by reporting to federal agents the illegal immigrants they come into contact with. As it stands, hundreds of cities across the nation &#8212; many with Democratic mayors or city councils &#8212; are refusing to do so. Trump has signed an executive order directing Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to find ways to starve these sanctuary cities of federal funding. A <a
href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sanctuarycities-idUSKBN1592V9">Reuters analysis</a> found the top 10 sanctuary cities in the U.S. receive $2.27 billion in federal funding for programs ranging from public health services to early childhood education. <img
src="http://www.informationliberation.com/files/poll-harvard-harris-sanctuary-cities.png" width="640" /> Kelly is expected to hire thousands of new immigration enforcement agents with broad authority to detain and deport those in the country illegally, potentially setting up a showdown between the federal government and sanctuary cities. The Harvard&#8211;Harris Poll survey found strong support for an overhaul of the nation&#8217;s immigration laws, with 77 percent saying they support comprehensive immigration reform against only 23 percent who oppose. &#8220;While there is broad support for comprehensive immigration reform, there is overwhelming opposition to sanctuary cities,&#8221; said Harvard&#8211;Harris co-director Mark Penn. &#8220;The public wants honest immigrants treated fairly and those who commit crimes deported and that&#8217;s very clear from the data.&#8221; The finding is one of several in the survey that show Trump has support for some of the controversial immigration proposals that were a hallmark of his campaign. A majority &#8212; 52 percent &#8212; say they support Trump&#8217;s two executive orders allowing for the construction of a southern border wall, increasing the number of immigration officers by 10,000 and finding a way to revoke federal funds for sanctuary cities. The crackdown on sanctuary cities is the most popular feature of those actions, followed closely by the directive to increase the border patrol, which is backed by 75 percent of voters. Seeing as how the polls underrepresented Trump&#8217;s support before the election, we can safely say the real numbers are even higher. The results show clearly Americans want these aliens deported and do not believe &#8220;they&#8217;re enriching our culture&#8221; and &#8220;helping our economy.&#8221; <img
src="https://www.informationliberation.com/files/AScFSco.jpg" width="640" border="1" /> Even though the public overwhemingly supports kicking these aliens out, corrupt politicians on both sides of the aisle supported bringing them all in and letting them stay even though it&#8217;s cost us billions of dollars and gotten thousands of innocent people like Kate Steinle killed. All the numbers show Trump&#8217;s agenda is wildly popular. While the media is in overdrive trying to demonize him by lying about him with an endless stream of fake news, if the sold out, cucked Republicans will just get in line and force his agenda through they&#8217;ll be looking at decades of Republican rule. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials tried to hack Indiana’s state electoral system with at least 14,800 “scans” or hits between Nov. 1, 2016, to Dec. 16, 2016, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned. The attacks are the second confirmed IT scanning assault by DHS officials against states that resisted then-President Barack Obama’s attempt to increase federal involvement in state and local election systems by designating them as “critical infrastructure” for national security. Members of the National Association of Secretaries of State voted Saturday at their winter meeting to oppose the designation. They are asking President Donald Trump to overturn it. Former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was also Trump’s vice presidential-elect during much of the period covered by the DHS scans of the Indiana system. Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson, the incoming president of the association, told TheDCNF Tuesday that, “we know that between November 1 and December 16 we were scanned with about 14,800 scans, nearly 15,000 different times.” The state’s IT team traced the intruder to a DHS computer’s IP address. The same DHS unit attempted 10 times in 2016 to hack into the Georgia electoral system. Federal officials are barred under DHS rules from trying to penetrate a state system without the express approval of the state. Neither Georgia nor Indiana approved the DHS scanning attempts. <a

Throughout the 2016 presidential election, Trump made the issue of building a southern border wall central to his political campaign, with fervent supporters across the country chanting, “Build the wall!” at many of his rallies. &#8220;A nation without borders is not a nation. Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control as it gets back its borders,&#8221; Trump declared after signing the executive order last month. On Tuesday, DHS also released a <a

The advertiser sent a vaguely-worded email to the Infowars legal department saying it was ending its ad campaign in part because “all political content should focus on the merits of the candidate,” implying that corrupt, establishment candidates such as Hillary Clinton should be showered with praise and her scandals ignored. This seems to contradict another statement in the same email in which AdRoll claims “all content on your website should be relevant, accurate, informative, and up to date;” if a news web site is to focus on only the “merits” of a political candidate and not the controversies, how is that accurate? <iframe

AdRoll even slandered Breitbart by accusing the site of “hate speech,” which is not only an unprofessional accusation, but it also points to a political &#8211; not business &#8211; motivation behind the blacklisting.

The money trail hunt begins with a document Infowars has obtained from the Russian Central Bank “Registry of Significant Control,” known generally as the “RSC Registry.” This document traces the ownership of Metcombank, a relatively small Russian-domiciled bank located in the Russian Ural Mountains, to ownership by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire with close ties to Putin. As we shall see this document provides evidence of the circuitous path the Russian government has been using since Hillary Clinton was secretary of state to make large financial payments to John Podesta and to the Clinton Foundation. <iframe

<em>Be sure to keep referring to this document to cross-check as you continue reading the article below.</em> As the RSC Registry makes clear, Vekselberg has been paying Clinton and Podesta through a complicated money laundering scheme involving Metcombank in Russia, with payments tracing back to the Renova Group, a Russian-based energy and investment international conglomerate also owned by Vekselberg. The funds rediverted to Clinton and Podesta through the Renova Group and Metcombank originate in large part from Rusnano — a state-owned investment fund owned by the Russian government. Conveniently, Vekselberg is a <a

The entire scheme involves a Netherlands-listed private company that plays prominently into the international money laundering the Russian government has been conducting through offshore entities in the Cayman Islands, as documented by the Panama Papers. Money laundering schemes created by professional criminals are typically complicated.  To begin understanding the RSC registry on Metcombank, note that the bottom box on the chart (second page) makes clear that Vekselberg effectively owns 100 percent of Metcombank.
