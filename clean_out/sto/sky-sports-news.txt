"The only thing we are guilty of as a team is underachieving which we all acknowledge both in the dressing room and publicly and will do our best to rectify. I wish Claudio the very very best in whatever the future holds for him. Thank You Claudio for everything."Fabregas played the midfield metronome role to perfection - as much ticky-tocka as tiki-taka - splintered his short passing with the odd well-aimed slingshot into the runs of Costa and Eden Hazard, and caused Swansea countless problems with his ambitious late arrivals in their box.By that stage the game was level. Somehow. Swansea manager Paul Clement, returning to the club where he won the title as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant, had called the trip a "shot to nothing" for Swansea, but they registered naught in the shots column until the final few seconds of the first half when Gylfi Sigurdsson's flat free-kick was met by Llorente as Chelsea's defence dithered.Had the game finished even there might have been words about the legitimacy of the free-kick - dubiously awarded against N'Golo Kante - but Swansea had a complaint of their own when Azpilicueta's outstretched arm blocked Sigurdsson's flick after the break.And the game was up when Costa slammed in Hazard's cut-back on the volley (84) for a 16th league goal, Swansea slipping to a third league defeat of Clement's promising tenure that leaves them three points above the relegation places with an overdue run of four bottom-half opponents to come.Scotland only found their groove with five first-half minutes remaining and a late Russell penalty saw them trail by four at the break, but they picked up where they left off after the restart. A great dummy line from Huw Jones fixed Williams and allowed Seymour to cross in the corner.Jones, asked whether he might have gone for the points with hindsight, replied: "I would have liked to. The kickers didn't want to, so we went for the corner. Then I got done for blocking at the back of the lift, but I would have liked to have gone for the three."The Doncaster man had hoped to join brother Jamie as a world champion, becoming the first British twins to hold titles, but his spirited finish could not deny Vargas from taking victory with two scores of 117-111, 116-112, while the third judge controversially made it a 114-114 draw.
