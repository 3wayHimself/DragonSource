[The dinner] has been and will continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic said Jeff Mason WHCA president . We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession . Questions about whether the dinner was appropriate existed before Trump took office . The event is an annual gathering of journalists and the people they cover typically headlined by the sitting president . The White House Correspondents Associationawards $100000 in scholarships at its annual dinner according to its website and recently started a mentoring program that pairs working journalists with journalism students . The annual dinner began in 1921 and Calvin Coolidge became the first president to attend the dinner in 1924 . In 1978 Jimmy Carter declined to attend citing exhaustion . First lady Rosalynn Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale also didnt show up that year No one is happier no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald said Obama who ultimately released his birth certificate . Thats because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter like: Did we fake the moon landing ? What really happened in Roswell ? And where are Biggie and Tupac ? All kidding aside obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience Obama said . For example no seriously just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice at the steakhouse the mens cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks . And there was a lot of blame to go around but you Mr . Trump recognized that the problem was a lack of leadership and so ultimately you didnt blame Little John or Meatloaf you fired Gary Busey . And these are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night . Well-handled sir . Well-handled . Former labor secretary Thomas Perez was elected the first Latino chair of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday narrowly defeating Rep . Keith Ellison D-Minn . at the end of a contentious battle over the fate of the beleaguered party in the age of President Trump . Perezs victory concluded the first contested race for the DNC leadership since 1985 a contest the party had extended by a month to allow more debate . It put in place the Democratic leadership that will navigate thousands of state and local elections where the party hopes to reverse the losses of the past six years and a 2020 presidential race that could divide the party again . Ellisons defeat was a blow to the partys liberal wing personified by activists labor leaders and organizers many of whom had supported the presidential bid of Sen . Bernie Sanders I-Vt . and had come to Atlanta to cheer Ellison on . Many of them warned that by picking Perez the party was alienating the growing resistance that has organized against Trump . The race was close enough that it required a second round of balloting with Perez winning 235 of 435 votes cast . With tensions still high as the result was announced nine Ellison supporters chanted Party for the people not big money ! and stormed out of the room . Someday theyre going to study this era of American history Perez said after his win . Theyre going to ask the question of all of us: Where were you in 2017 when we had the worst president in the history of the United States ? We will be able to say that the Democratic Party led the resistance and made sure this was a one-term president . Sanders who had supported Ellison said in a statement that it was imperative that Tom understands that the same-old same-old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before . The vote itself was tense . On Friday night Democrats gathered at a downtown Westin hotel here in Atlanta to meet drink and lobby for votes and the Ellison campaign along with allies of South Bend Ind . Mayor Pete Buttigieg a third candidate battled rumors that Perez might already have locked up the votes he needed . But by Saturday morning it was clear that the race was up for grabs . Buttigieg used his nomination speech to quit the race endorsing no candidate . As most of the 439 DNC members present cast their votes eight eligible members did not attend several DNC members got a text from the Ellison camp saying the congressman was grateful to have the support of Mayor Buttigieg an endorsement that the mayor denied . In the first round of balloting Perez won 213 . 5 votes to 200 for Ellison 12 for Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown 0 . 5 for Democratic strategist Jehmu Greene and one for Buttigieg in the first round of balloting . Greene endorsed Perez while two fringe candidates who had won no votes backed Ellison . Members who are abroad get half a vote . Perezs victory did not represent a Democratic shift to the right . On key issues Perezs platform mostly resembled Ellisons . Perez promised to refocus on small donors and online fundraising; Ellison set a goal for low-dollar contributions from everyday Americans [to] account for 33percent of revenue . Ellison called for an Innovation Hub in Silicon Valley; Perez promoted DNC fellowships to encourage developers programmers data scientists [and] engineers . While Perez and Ellison praised each other personally the race was defined for outsiders by Sanderss support of the Minnesota lawmaker . Ellison was one of the few members of Congress who had backed Sanders for president . He billed himself as the unity candidate who would keep Sanderss restive supporters in the party while embracing those who had backed Clinton . In the first weeks after Ellison declared his candidacy the strategy seemed to be working despite some hiccups . Labor unions that had endorsed Clinton such as the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees got behind Ellison . Howard Dean the most successful DNC chair in modern party history dropped his plans to run again when Ellison said he would resign from Congress if elected to the full-time job . Senate Minority Leader Charles E . Schumer D-N . Y . who had frequently clashed with Dean over strategy and investments endorsed Ellison and defended the first Muslim member of Congress against charges of anti-Semitism . But veterans of the Obama administration where Perez had been a popular liberal force encouraged the former labor secretary to run and starting Dec . 15 he did . In progressive media the race was frequently covered as a clash between the establishment and the revolution that had been proved right by the 2016 election . That was not how most DNC members chose to see it . In public forums including the final one broadcast on CNN Ellison and Perez declined to criticize each other . While progressive media outlets accused Perez of protecting the partys consultant class DNC members who broke for Perez said that he had convinced them that he knew what state parties needed . Perez was also helped by a string of endorsements from Obama administration veterans although as Ellison backers noticed he did not win any high-profile supporters of Sanderss to compete with Ellisons endorsements from Clintonites . The Feb . 1 endorsement of Perez by former vice president Joe Biden one of the partys most beloved figures prompted Sanders to criticize Perez for the first time . Do we stay with a failed status-quo approach or do we go forward with a fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party ? Sanders asked in a statement after Bidens endorsement . I say we go forward and create a grassroots party which speaks for working people and is prepared to stand up to the top one percent . Most of the DNCs membership just 39 of whom had backed Sanders for president in 2016 did not view the contest as a stark ideological clash . Sanders supporters including Ellison had largely succeeded in moving the partys platform to the left . In interviews some acknowledged that there would be walkouts by Sanders die-hards in their states but they argued that the daily outrages around Trump might bring them back into the process . That confidence was on display Saturday before the vote for chairman . DNC members debated whether to strike language from Californias Christine Pelosi House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosis daughter that would have restored a ban on corporate donations to the DNC . The prohibition was quietly rolled back during the controversial tenure of the previous elected DNC chair Rep . Debbie Wasserman Schultz D-Fla . This resolution has nothing to do with nonprofit organizations said Larry Cohen a former president of the Communications Workers of America who backed Sanders in 2016 . This is to send a message loud and clear that the DNC itself not candidates not state parties will restore the ban that President Obama put into effect . In a question-and-answer session at the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC in Maryland Pruitt blamed the Obama administration for failing to tackle more state-based environmental issues such as a decades-old water quality issues in Oregon tied to a nuclear facility in Washington . Acting at the behest of the White House the officials made calls to news organizations last week in attempts to challenge stories about alleged contacts between members of President Trumps campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives U . S . officials said . The White House on Friday acknowledged those interactions with the FBI but did not disclose that it then turned to other officials who agreed to do what the FBI would not participate in White House-arranged calls with news organizations including The Washington Post . The officials broadly dismissed Trump associates contacts with Russia as infrequent and inconsequential . But the officials would not answer substantive questions about the issue and their comments were not published by The Post and do not appear to have been reported elsewhere . White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed that the White House communicated with officials with the aim of contesting reporting on Russia but maintained that the administration did nothing improper . When informed by the FBI that [the Russia-related reporting] was false we told reporters who else they should contact to corroborate the FBIs version of the story he said . The effort also involved senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia including Sen . Richard Burr R-N . C . and Rep . Devin Nunes R-Calif . the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees . A spokesman for Nunes said that he had already begun speaking to reporters to challenge the story and that at the request of a White House communications aide Chairman Nunes then spoke to an additionalreporter and delivered the same message . In an interview Burr acknowledged that he had conversations about Russia-related news reports with the White House and engaged with news organizations to dispute articles by the New York Times and CNN that alleged repeated or constant contact between Trump campaign members and Russian intelligence operatives . Administration officials said that Priebuss comments had been cleared by FBI Director James B . Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe . In doing so the FBIs leadership would appear to have been drawing a distinction between authorizing comments by a White House official and addressing the matter themselves . I am consulting with members of the Intelligence Committee to determine an appropriate course of action so we can ensure that the American people get the thorough impartial investigation that they deserve free from White House interference Warner said in a statement Friday night . Rep . Adam B . Schiff Calif . the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement Friday evening saying that if the White House contrived to have intelligence officials contradict unfavorable news reports this represents a new and even more grave threat to the independence of the intelligence community . Former intelligence officials expressed concern over the blurring of lines between intelligence and politics with some recalling Republican accusations that the Obama administration had twisted intelligence in its accounts of the 2012 attacks on U . S . facilities in Benghazi Libya . I doubt that there was any enthusiasm from the intelligence leadership to get involved in this in the first place former CIA director Michael Hayden said noting that it seemed unlikely that Priebuss bluntly worded denials were consistent with the precise language favored by intelligence analysts . Think Benghazi here Hayden said in an interview by email . This is what happens when the intel guys are leaned on for the narrative of the political speakers . The latter have different rules words purposes . Getting intel into that mix always ends unhappily [and] it looks like we just did . White House officials declined to comment on the administrations subsequent effort to enlist other government officials and would not agree to allow the identification of the intelligence officials who had spoken to The Post last week . In separate calls those individuals insisted on being identified only as a senior intelligence official in the Trump administration and a senior member of the intelligence community . In a brief interview on the night of Feb . 15 the senior intelligence official said that the suggestion that there was frequent contact between Russians and Trump associates was false describing any conversations as sporadic limited and based on Russias interest in building a relationship with the future Trump administration rather than shaping the 2016 presidential race . The senior intelligence official appeared to be referring to contacts between Trumps designated national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump was sworn in as president . Flynn was forced out of his job earlier this month after The Post reported that Officials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on whether senior officials at those agencies had discussed Russia coverage with the White House or been involved in efforts to refute stories on that subject . It is not unusual for CIA leaders to have contact with news organizations particularly about global issues such as terrorism or to contest news accounts of CIA operations . But involving the agency on alleged Trump campaign ties to Russia could be problematic . The CIA is not in charge of the investigation . Given the history of domestic espionage abuses in the United States CIA officials are typically averse to being drawn into matters that involve U . S . citizens or might make the agency vulnerable to charges that it is politicizing intelligence . U . S . intelligence reports cite multiple contacts between members of Trumps team and Russians with links to the Kremlin during the campaign and afterward according to officials who have seen them . Such reports were based on intercepted Russian communications and other sources the officials said . Nunes who served as a member of Trumps transition team has resisted calls for his House committee to investigate alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russia . He said in an interview that after months of investigations U . S . authorities have turned up no evidence of such contacts . For instance Bush passed the TroubledAsset Relief Program in October 2008 which used just over $426 billion in federal funds to [[Q-1]] the country's largest banks . Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February 2009 which allocated $831 billion in federal funds to finance investment projects such as infrastructure . The labor market has improved drastically with unemployment at just 4 . 8% and the number of people claiming unemployment benefits nearing the lowest point in 40 years . In fact during Obama's term the US added over 11 million private sector jobs . While it's not all perfect business investment is lagging wages still haven't hit pre-crisis levels and economic gains have not been equally distributed throughout the country there is no doubt that Trump inherits a better economic starting position than Obama did in 2009 with no reason to spend massive amounts of federal money to assist the economy . In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference Mr . Trump criticized as fake news organizations that publish anonymously sourced reports that reflect poorly on him . And in a series of Twitter posts he assailed the F . B . I . as a dangerously porous agency condemning unauthorized revelations of classified information from within its ranks and calling for an immediate hunt for leakers . Hours after the speech as if to demonstrate Mr . Trumps determination to punish reporters whose coverage he dislikes Sean Spicer the White House press secretary barred journalists from The New York Times and several other news organizations from attending his daily briefing a highly unusual breach of relations between the White House and its press corps . The moves underscored the degree to which Mr . Trump and members of his inner circle are eager to use the prerogatives of the presidency to undercut those who scrutinize him dismissing negative stories as lies and confining press access at the White House to a few chosen news organizations considered friendly . The Trump White House has also vowed new efforts to punish leakers . by CNN on Thursday night that a White House official had asked the F . B . I . to rebut a New York Times article last week detailing contacts between Mr . Trumps associates and Russian intelligence officials . The report asserted that a senior White House official had called top leaders at the F . B . I . to request that they contact reporters to dispute the Timess account . The fake news doesnt tell the truth Mr . Trump said to the delight of the conservatives packed into the main ballroom at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center just south of Washington . It doesnt represent the people it doesnt and never will represent the people and were going to do something about it . In the West Wing less than three hours later the consequences were becoming clear . Mr . Spicer told a handpicked group of reporters in a briefing in his spacious office that the White House would relentlessly counter coverage it considered inaccurate . Were going to aggressively push back he said according to a recording of the session provided by a reporter who was allowed to attend . Were just not going to sit back and let you know false narratives false stories inaccurate facts get out there . Reporters from The Times BuzzFeed News CNN The Los Angeles Times Politico the BBC and The Huffington Post were among those shut out of the briefing . Aides to Mr . Spicer admitted only reporters from a group of news organizations that the White House said had been previously confirmed . Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties Dean Baquet the executive editor of The Times said in a statement . We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations . Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest . We invited the pool so everyone was represented Sarah Huckabee Sanders the deputy White House press secretary said in an email Friday afternoon referring to the small group of reporters on hand at the White House each day to follow the president and send reports to the broader press corps . We decided to add a couple of additional people beyond the pool . Nothing more than that . The White House Correspondents Association which represents the press corps also protested the decision . But Jeff Mason the organizations president pointed out that the White House had provided near-daily briefings and accepted questions from a variety of news outlets since Mr . Trump took office . Were not happy with how things went today Mr . Mason said in an interview . But its important to keep in mind the context of how things have gone up until now . He added: I dont think that people should rush to judgment to suggest that this is the start of a big crackdown on media access . It is not the job of political leaders to determine how journalists should conduct their work and sets a terrible example for the rest of the world said the groups executive director Joel Simon . The U . S . should be promoting press freedom and access to information . Those comments came shortly after his own aides had held a briefing for the White House press pool on the condition of anonymity to deny CNNs story suggesting there had been improper contact between the White House and the F . B . I . regarding the Times article on Russian contacts . Later in the briefing from which the Times was excluded Mr . Spicer said that it was top F . B . I . officials first Andrew G . McCabe the deputy director and later James B . Comey the director who approached Reince Priebus the White House chief of staff the day after the article appeared to say that it was false . The F . B . I . on Friday declined to provide its account of those conversations . On Thursday night an F . B . I . official said that the White House had asked last week for the bureaus help disputing the article and that senior F . B . I . officials had rejected the request citing the investigation into Russian efforts to affect the election . s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election . The intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr . Trump was Mr . Spicers small-group Friday session known as a gaggle was scheduled as an off-camera event less formal than his usual briefings that are carried live on cable news . But past administrations have not selected outlets that can attend such sessions . Tensions always emerge between an administration and the reporters who cover it and it is not unusual for a White House to single out groups of journalists for special briefings outside of the daily on-camera question-and-answer session . The Obama White House was harshly criticized by members of the press corps after it tried to exclude Fox News from interviews with top administration officials . In Heidelberg the attacker described by police as a 35-year-old German [[Q-2]] drove what is thought to be a rental car into pedestrians in one of the city's central squares injuring three people . One of them a 73-year-old German man later died in hospital .

The investigation has unleashed a serious diplomatic fight between Malaysia and North Korea a prime suspect in the Feb . 13 killing of Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur's airport . Friday's revelation by Malaysian police that the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent was used to kill Kim raised the stakes significantly in a case that has broad geopolitical implications . Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam said the state chemistry department's finding of the VX toxin confirmed the hospital's autopsy result that suggested a [[Q-4]] that led to death [[Q-5]] The VX agent can lead to death very quickly in high doses he said . Tens of thousands of passengers have passed through the airport since the apparent assassination was carried out . No areas were cordoned off and protective measures were not taken .

It can be inhaled swallowed or absorbed through the skin . Then in anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours it can cause a range of symptoms from blurred vision to a headache . Enough exposure leads to convulsions paralysis respiratory failure and death . In grainy surveillance footage the women appear to smear something onto Kim's face before walking away in separate directions . Malaysian police said the attackers knew what they were doing and had been trained to go immediately to the bathroom and clean their hands . Also Saturday police confirmed that a raid earlier in the week on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur was part of the investigation . Abdul Samah did not specify what authorities found there but said the items were being tested for traces of any chemicals . An allegedly intoxicated Navy veteran was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting of two Indian software engineers in a crowded bar in Olathe Kan . Wednesday evening . The assailant reportedly shouted Get out of my country ! One man died and the second was injured as well as a good Samaritan who tried to intervene . The possible hate crime has prompted anger in India and concern that the Trump-era United States is no longer a safe place for its thriving community of visiting Indian students scholars and tech workers . The father of Alok Madasani the Indian injured in the attack I used to think of America as a place where there is greater racial equality than exists in India said Dhriti Ahluwalia 26 a masters student who wants to attend a public policy program in the United States . Now people are afraid . There is inequality . There is racism . Everybody is asking me whether they should go or not whether they should look at U . S . schools or not said Kavita Singh who runs the college admissions counseling service FutureWorks Consulting in New Delhi . Many of her students will want to apply to elite schools on the coasts in blue states she said but say they dont want to look at schools in the middle of the country the red states anymore . And that was before Trumps travel ban threw immigration into chaos and ensnared students and scholars from some of the seven affected countries in its net . Indians said they are uneasy about possible future limitations on both student permissions as well as H-1B visas the foreign visas for highly skilled workers . The software engineers in the Kansas shooting Madasani and Srinivas Kuchibhotla 32 were admitted to work for a global tech company on H-1B visas after completing graduate studies in the United States . Right now everyones nervous said Tasaduq Hussain a PhD scholar in electrical engineering who said he still hopes to do postdoctoral work in the United States . He was more concerned about limits on visa than his safety: The United States is a big country and there will be stray incidents he said . I dont think the American people are anti-Muslim . Rep . Darrell Issa R-Calif . became one of the few Republican representatives to state publicly the needfor an independent investigation into Russia's reported election meddling . This comes as Democrats have increasingly pushed for an investigation intoIn an appearance on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher Issaa senior member of the House Judiciary Committee first told the progressive show host that House and Senate intelligence committees would look into Russia's activities within the special areas they oversee . concluded that hackers with connections to the Russian government targeted the Democratic National Committee and leaked thousands of emails to WikiLeaks in an effort to sway the outcome in Trump's favor . United States intelligence agencies have said they agree with the assessment and a Maher protested saying there needed to be aspecial prosecutor and that now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions should recuse himself the same way former Attorney General Loretta Lynch recused herself from an investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails . If merely being a supporter of the Presidents during the campaign warranted recusal from involvement in any matter involving [Trump] then most typical presidential appointees would be unable to conduct their duties Sessions told Sen . Patrick J . Leahy D-Vt . in written responses to the Senate Judiciary Committee Here's the reason we're going to have to do it Bill . There may or may not be fault but the American people who are beginning to understand that Putin murders his enemies sometimes right in front of the Kremlin and then suddenly the cameras don't work there he's murdered people and taken down [sic] using cyberwarfare in Georgia and Ukraine . This is a bad guy who murders people who runs a gas station with an economy the size of Italy but is screwing up things all over the world that we've been doing 'working with . ' Now we have to work with them . We don't have to trust them . And we need to investigate their activities and we need to do it because they are bad people . In response tweets with the hashtag #WhereIsDarrell began appearing . Another video from the event showed Issa's face attached to a large cardboard cutout of Waldothe purposely hard-to-spot cartoon character that was the star of a children's book series . When Maher brought up the lawmaker's absence from the town hall Issa defended himself by saying that he had over 14 separate events open to the public in the last two weeks and that he had spoken to several hundred people who showed up outside his office to protest recently .
