But not just any boat . Specifically the Spirit of Mount Vernon a three-story monstrosity of casino-style carpeting and damp furniture floating in the Potomac River just a few yards from the Gaylord International Hotel in National Harbor Maryland . They were onboard Friday evening for the Breitbart luau held in celebration of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference which in 2017 is 44 years old . Hawaiian attire optional but encouraged the invitation decorated with an illustration of a dead pig branded with the Breitbart logo read . Mahalo ! The boat had been set to depart at 8 p . m . sharp but due to an overwhelming number of invitees who expressed worry about being trapped on a boat for an extended period of time with the people who invented Milo Yiannopoulos the plan changed . The boat would stay docked from 7:30 to 11 and all who entered would be given a lei of fuchsia flowers and be encouraged to purchase a tropical beverage made with blue curacao from the cash bar . CPAC is the most famous conservative confab in America . Ronald Reagan its attendees are eager to inform spoke here thirteen times . And in recent years its been the place where fringe right-wing figures were laundered into the mainstream: its where Donald Trump gave his first major political speech as well as a frequent stop for Ted Cruz Sarah Palin Ben Carson Michele Bachmann Mike Huckabee Rand and Ron Paul and virtually every other modern conservative politician youve ever heard of hell even the ones you havent heard of: Jim Gilmore was next to me at the bar here earlier . In the years leading up to a presidential election CPAC is where the Republican primary field takes shape; its difficult to run without developing a name for yourself among the thousands of conservatives who spend between $150 and $5000 to be here and the strategists pundits and journalists who come to watch . But the speeches and panels about guns abortion and the stealth start of World War III a real panel that took place this week in two parts over two days; the conceit being that the war has begun but few people have noticed are not the main event . The parties are ranging from your standard DC cocktail fare to the utterly deranged . In previous years there was former Texas congressmanthese guys did seem to be having the most fun after all . But this year the year that Breitbart achieved its ultimate electoral triumph something was off . Although word around CPAC was that security would be tight the crowd in the Spirit of Mount Vernon was so patchy that party crashers seemed a welcome presence . CPAC in 2017 was in some ways defined by Breitbart . It was Breitbart not establishment conservatives who supported Trump throughout the Republican primary long before it seemed possible he could be president . In the main hallway the website had a sedan-sized booth where its well known writers like the spherical Matthew Boyle lingered and shook hands with readers . And Bannon who departed the website to join the Trump administration as the presidents chief strategist spoke on a panel with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus an event moderated and granted legitimacy by Matt Schlapp the president of the American Conservative Union CPACs host . This was a departure from years past when Breitbart was the scrappy outsider and it wasnt yet evident that the fringe right had any real power . In 2013 and 2014 Breitbart hosted off-site events called The Uninvited for those not welcome on the premises like Ann Coulter who was it seems unbelievable now deemed too controversial . I didnt like The Uninvited Schlapp said while introducing Bannon and Priebus onstage . Everybodys part of our conservative family . But like a family not everyone gets along . With a controversial Republican in the White House conservatism finds itself in the midst of an identity crisis . Establishment figures like Schlapp have been rendered irrelevant while Breitbart with its newfound influence and staffers joining the administration is attempting to mainstream itself by poaching from places like the with a shockingly beautiful face held court nearby . While Dog dispensed compliments to passersby he told me I have bright eyes and ran his hands through Jezebel reporter Prachi Guptas hair Beth attempted to convince a young woman working for Project Veritas James OKeefes undercover video outfit to investigate something . Earlier in the evening the couple had hosted a cocktail hour in the Gaylords Chesapeake suite in honor of Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke a Trump booster who some are attempting to draft for the Senate in 2018 . Not far away Nigel Farage the British populist politician who campaigned for Brexit was dutifully posing for selfies and smoking a cigarette . OKeefe meanwhile sipped his blue cocktail and walked around the boat with his camera crew for what he said was a documentary . At one point he agreed to pose for a photo wearing a lei and holding a pineapple . A number of members of what was described to me as the new right congregated in Shellys Back Room a cigar bar on F Street back in DC . There was the host Mike Cernovich a social media personality who was instrumental in spreading rumors about Clintons failing health during the election and Michael Flynn Jr . the conspiracy-minded son of recently departed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn . Before long OKeefe was at this party too sans herbaceous perennial . Im new right its different . He sees himself in this group he said with Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist radio host and founder of Infowars; Paul Joseph Watson the Infowars editor; Tucker Carlson the Fox News host a choice that might surprise some; and Yiannopoulos whom he continues to believe in despite his recent controversy . He was almost in the majors he said of Yiannopoulos but hell be back in a year . These were not he was careful to clarify members of the alt-right . That group he complained only had his initial support due to a misunderstanding . I didnt realize it was like a white ethno-nationalist thing he said . They lost it with the nazi salute . There was some drama as one dark horse South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropped out just before balloting began . He did not endorse either of the front-runners but one of his most visible backers Howard Dean switched his support to Ellison . There was also grumbling from the Ellison camp when Acting Chair Donna Brazile announced the electronic voting system set up for the election would not be used out of fears of external interference . After the first ballot Perez was just one vote short of the 218 needed but Ellison was in striking distance with 200 votes . In the end Perez who had a progressive reputation but had become the favorite of party centrists and loyalists to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had just enough broad support to edge Ellison 235-200 . The Minnesota congressman was very much the candidate of the Bernie Sanders camp and of other Democrats who thought retaining and mobilizing the energy of Sanders supporters was critical to the immediate future of a party fighting Donald Trump . Now the unity gestures will begin though you can be sure media Democrat-friendly and -unfriendly will be on the lookout for angry veterans of The Bern who are unreconciled to another victory for the Democratic Establishment . One source of disgruntlement may be a vote taken just before the balloting for chair in which a resolution The DNC is now going through the time-consuming process of electing its lower-level officers . But in the hallways of the Peachtree Plaza Hotel where Democrats meet there will be a continuing saga of efforts made accepted or rejected to put this contest behind a party that needs a breather from any struggle for its soul . and that victory was less about the movies characters than director Rob Marshalls lavish adaptation of the 1975 stage production . Its part of a long trend . When the Oscars do reward female-driven films its often in a musical the biggest spate of such winners happened in the 1960s when by the Center for the Study of Women in Television at San Diego State University 29 percent of the highest-grossing films of 2016 featured female protagonists sadly an all-time high and an increase of 7 percent from 2015 while women characters still only accounted for 32 percent of all total speaking parts . Gender stereotypes remained the same: Female characters were still less likely than male characters to be seen at work or portrayed as leaders . on the ballot this year . Its the first Best Picture nominee in history to feature an ensemble of highly educated female characters let alone a nonwhite cast engaged in a heroic professional pursuit . The last contender with a comparably diverse cast was 2012s likely Oscar victories especially Stones for playing a woman whose creative aspirations are treated as worthy as those of her male love interest . This is an especially poignant theme at a time when many women in America feel under siege and Hollywood itself is struggling to reconcile its own isnt expected to win an Oscar this weekend but an underdog victory would put the musician close to an EGOT . Sting has an Emmy for an A&E concert special a little over a decade ago plus over a dozen Grammys for his solo career alongside the handful he earned with the Police . If he has a little involvement in the there are several tech categories where this modern musical would be breaking precedent by winning I suspect its doable . Below you can take a look at my bullish predictions or listen as I discuss each category on this weeks big new episode of and thats significant . Since 2003 every SAG winner in this category has gone on to take the Oscar . This will be a nail-biter down to to the last second since Washingtons momentum has come so late in the game but Id give him the slim edge over Affleck . when people start wondering whether Isabelle Huppert can beat her . Every time a young ingenue leads the field bored pundits posit that a veteran actress can take her down but Annette Bening didnt defeat Natalie Portman in 2010 Emmanuelle Riva couldnt beat Jennifer Lawrence in 2012 and last year Charlotte Rampling had no luck against Brie Larson . Emma will take it and you can take that to the bank . s first act . Jeff Bridges fits the more conventional profile of a winner here its a showy performance with a gangbusters final scene but hes won before . Dev Patel took the BAFTA in this category but Im not sure that will be enough . In the end while Ali is highly deserving he could prevail in part due to the lack of a strong rival . managed it is indicative of just how much the Academy loves this movie and since its almost certain to win Best Sound Mixing and a lot of Academy members still dont really know the difference between editing and mixing I think it will end up taking both Oscars since the entire Academy votes on these categories not just the sound branch that selects the nominations . The safer money is on the hellish war cacophony of are the only Oscar-winning shorts I care to support but in the interest of helping you win your Oscar pool I think the frontrunners here tend to be the biggest crowd-pleasers though since so few voters actually make time for the shorts theyre pleasing an awfully limited crowd . Its likely between The heart of the claim focuses on Otto a self-driving trucking company founded by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski and acquired by Uber for $680 million in August of 2016 . According to Waymo Levandowski intentionally accessed Waymos servers and downloaded 9 . 7 GB of Waymo data and documents copied them to an external hard drive and then wiped his laptop in an attempt to hide his trail all shortly before leaving to start Otto in January of 2016 . Google claims this was calculated theft that allowed Otto and later Uber to steal trade secrets about Waymos Light Detection and Ranging or LiDAR system which uses a 360-degree array of lasers to provide self-driving vehicles with the vital information of whats happening on the road around it . lays out an interesting timeline for the case . After Uber acquired Otto in August of 2016 Google decided to take a closer look at the circumstances surrounding Levandowskis departure . As the charmingly mean-spirited complaint notes: Ottos purchase price was reported as $680 million a remarkable sum for a company with few assets and no marketable product . Many saw the Otto acquisition as a way for Uber to muscle its way into the trucking industry which The complaint states that Google quickly discovered Levandowskis alleged mass download from Waymo servers despite Levandowskis attempts to cover his trail . The complaint also mentions that Google discovered that several other former Google employees who joined Levandowskis new company had similarly copied information about suppliers and manufacturing details . But for whatever reason Google held off any legal action . This changed in December when a supplier accidentally emailed a Google employee an attachment meant for Uber . When the attachment was opened it showed a schematic for Ubers planned LiDAR tech which Google claims looked nearly identical to its own design including an innovation by Google that allowed its LiDAR system to use only one lens for receiving information which greatly reduces cost and complications in manufacturing a working LiDAR array . Its hard to calculate the potential fallout of the lawsuit but it has the potential to be devastating . Its a rarity in tech patent-infringement lawsuits in that Googles complaint states it has forensic evidence of actual theft versus just pointing toward the similarity between the two companies products . This could greatly increase the liability hanging over Uber and could make Uber more willing to settle out of court . But the impact could be felt by Uber before the case is either settled or makes its way to a jury trial . Google is seeking a preliminary injunction against Uber which would likely halt Ubers ambitious real-world testing and demonstration of its self-driving cars and trucks . is already facing a strong headwind thanks to a long press cycle that has turned #DeleteUber into a trending topic on Twitter and made the company a byword for Silicon Valley arrogance misogyny and anti-worker attitudes . Prominent VC investor Kate Mitchell of Scale Ventures said on Tuesday that Ubers self-inflicted wounds over Its also worth noting that Google Ventures Googles VC investment fund put $250 million into Uber in 2013 . Googles senior vice-president David Drummond even sat on Ubers board for a time . Shortly after Uber acquired Otto Drummond stepped down . Still the investment remains which presents the odd situation where a company owned by Google is suing a company in which Google owns a significant stake . The lawsuit could ultimately affect how much Google will be able to cash out on its investment if Ubers IPO is indeed affected . is the only one Ive seen twice . Im not going to sing its praises again here there are many others who have done it justice . But what I truly loved about the movie was the way in which it managed to transcend identity politics almost effortlessly . It never seemed to be straining to say that it was a groundbreaking movie about being gay and black in America; it simply told a story of being human in America . Part of that may be a function of how our society has shifted so that movies about the gay experience can now shrug off their otherness; but part too surely is because the director Barry Jenkins is straight . By all accounts he worked closely with Tarell Alvin McCraney the gay man who created the story . But like Ang Lee in he didnt shy from what some now call cultural appropriation . He seized it . And so we got to see an authentically gay story through a straight mans eyes and the view was beautiful . Sometimes its precisely the tension in cultural appropriation that creates the greatest art because a work of translation is at its best also one of empathy . Attempting to shut this cross-pollination down may come from good intentions; but its a fatal political constriction on what art can really achieve . In art the only identity that ultimately matters is that of the artist . The whole point is to leave the rest behind . we saw a 7 percent drop in suicides among gay teens in states that allowed marriage equality between 1999 and 2015 relative to rates in states where gay marriage was still banned . Theres no causal relationship proven here just a strong correlation so a degree of skepticism is merited . You can and should captured so exquisitely . In the old days as soon as you realized you might be gay you understood immediately that youd never be worthy of the marriage your parents or siblings had . That knowledge often pierced the young psyche with shame and stigma and wounded your self-esteem for life . More distressing: Almost by definition many of these most troubled kids dont and wont acknowledge their feelings and so are resistant to counseling . But with legalizing marriage equality there is another way to reach them by the law itself telling this invisible and silent group that their state sees them as equal to their peers . Its an anti-suicide measure all by itself requiring no counselors carried in the general atmosphere removing or decreasing stigma . In that sense you could call marriage equality a public health initiative . A staggering 28 . 5 percent of high school students who are sexual minorities attempt suicide each year . If marriage equality helps keep one of them from killing herself or the trauma of trying that would be a blessing beyond measure . That it might correlate with a decline in attempted suicides among all gay kids the study assesses 134000 fewer incidents a year is a dream come true . Which is why marriage equality was never in the end about choosing politics . It was always at its core about choosing life . I dont know about you but the abject terror and anxiety of the last few months have abated somewhat . This is not I hasten to add because we have learned much that should reassure us about this unhinged authoritarian in the Oval Office . The rhetoric has not exactly mellowed . Not long after he called the press the enemy of the American people he called his deportation revamp a military operation for Petes sake . Its just a matter of human endurance . You have to breathe at some point to pace yourself to find more spaces in your life and your soul where Trump cannot invade . There are only so many truthful hyperboles or tweet storms a person can withstand . My bodys habitual response after a period of intense stress and worry is to shut down with some kind of bronchial or sinus infection and lo and behold it has . Ive been spending the last couple of afternoons in a feverish oblivion . At some point though well have to find a balance between self-preservation and vigilance . You cant call in sick for four years . My only active constructive suggestion apart from constant grassroots pressure on congressmen and senators is to find a single issue on which to marshal the forces of the opposition . Release of the tax returns has always seemed the clearest candidate . The advantage of this particular issue is that it unites Republicans and Democrats . A found that 74 percent of Americans want the returns released including 53 percent of Republicans . It was a Trump promise after all . And if pressure on him cant work the Senate Intelligence Committee has the power to subpoena the returns in its investigation of the Kremlins hacking of the election . All we need is massive and sustained public pressure . So Im psyched to discover Im not the only one to like this idea . A former or subsequent rally last week did him any good either except for with his base which still gives him the Full Hannity . They wont budge but if Trump slips toward the mid-30s the congressional GOP may get colder feet especially those in districts won by Hillary Clinton . in support for early Trump than they were for late Obama . They dont like chaos or incompetence and theyve seen their fair share of both; theyre not going to like seeing peoples health insurance taken away from them . Nor do they enjoy unnerving scenes of mass deportations . They voted for Trump in part because they couldnt bring themselves to vote for Clinton but also one suspects out of a gamble that Trump may be good for the economy . If the economy goes south and remember Trump inherited a low unemployment rate and a long stock-market boom they could leave in droves . Its vital we dont push these people away from the opposition by too dogmatic or leftist a stance . Its crucial to keep a calm moderate and sane voice directed at exactly this 15 percent or so; and to simply hold Trump constantly accountable for the results of his policies especially on health care and jobs . If we cant remove him we can neuter him . And for that the coalition of opposition has to be as broad as possible . that those reports are grossly overstated and inaccurate which is not quite the same Ill note as completely untrue . This is what we call a standoff hence the Senate Intelligence Committees letters sent this week to several agencies asking them to preserve all records and information on the Russian attempt to hack the election . Heres hoping they didnt wait too long . The whole affair may well end up and investigative reporters . In ordinary times Id agree with those concerned about the CIA operating to counteract its own president even if only through leaks . But if theres a credible case that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and a hostile foreign power to hack our elections well the CIA knows their duty . They swore an oath to the Constitution not this president . And potential treason is surely an exception that proves the rule . Then you have to note the tiny advances and momentary reliefs in the first month: mounting public support for Obamacare and Republican disarray on repeal; Trumps capitulation on the One China policy; his acquiescence so far in the Iran nuclear deal; his exemption so far of the Dreamers from mass deportation; his keeping Obamas ruling for nondiscrimination against gay people in federal contracts; his deferral to the courts on the travel ban; and his selection of a sane well-regarded judge to replace Scalia . For most presidents these would be no-brainers . For Trump theyre small mercies shards of reality-based politics emerging among the chaos . At this point we have to take what solace we can . So I randomly discovered this at some shop in Brooklyn . I have tried so many lip balms that dont work I dont know why its so hard . Most of them just sit on top of your lips and dont absorb but I decided to try this one and fell in love with it . I then of course lost it in the back of a cab and immediately went back to the store and they were sold out ! I couldnt find it online either . So we took it into our own hands and figured out a way to sell it ourselves . I dont even know how to describe how good it is . Its silky smooth and absorbs really quickly . And we cant keep it in stock . . My apartment is so small that anything you spray on the counters gets sprayed on the fruit bowl and utensils so its important that its not like poison . It also just smells phenomenal . Its got this citrus scent because of the neroli and it doesnt even smell like a cleaner . Its more like a candle or room spray . We use it in the office and whenever someone comes in theyre like What is that ? This is something I think French women have been using forever but has only recently started taking hold in the U . S . Its a cleansing water for taking off your makeup which you put on a cotton pad and use to wipe your face . One of the things thats impossible for me are those presoaked cleansing wipes . I feel like they always leave my face gross and just dont work . But this water leaves my face soft and clean . Most days I get home and Im tired and I never want to wash my face off at the end of the day but I always remember to use this . I dont know how I turned into that person you know people who never exercise and then start and its such a fundamental personality shift ? Thats how I feel about what Ive turned into . It has to be the Lancme . I know theres the Bioderma that people like but this is better . and one of the founders is one of the most well-traveled people I know . She created the perfect suitcase . It has the phone charger which is clutch as anyone whos on the floor of the airport knows . For me though the wheels are the most important part . They are so much easier to roll . Unlike regular suitcases that you have to drag the bearings on this are so much better . Usually I get the worst shoulder tension from dragging a suitcase it always leads to migraines but this makes it so easy . . I was on the hunt for a natural deodorant for a while . Id read about the aluminum in antiperspirant and I did want to stay away from it but I tried a bunch of natural deodorants that never really worked . There was one I tried one summer that was ineffective to the point that I was reapplying on the street with Claire right after a meeting . This deodorant isnt an antiperspirant but it has clay in it that soaks up sweat in a different way . When I started using it I felt transformed . I had email exchanges with people about it . I remember Edith Zimmerman These things are awesome . I guess EVA is a molded-acetate thing so they just really conform . They weigh under a pound and are so light that I bring them in all my carry-ons . Ive actually been on trips where Ive made so many people lift these shoes just to see how light they are . Theyre great for girls and guys . I just wore them on a trip in Palm Springs . Theyre great house shoes . In fact I should probably get an indoor and outdoor pair just to keep the functions separate . I had never really done much to my brows because I didnt feel like I needed it . But this pencil totally changed that . So on one end is the pencil which is angled that makes such a difference . And the other end holds the brush which you use to blend . So you define it with the perfect pencil and blend it with the other side and it transforms your face . In fact one of our friends told Claire and me that she had nicknames for us Claire was Hair and I was Brows . Oh my gosh . This thing . So I dont understand people who cook a lot and dont have this thing . I hate how after you cook with garlic or onions your hands will smell like them for 36 hours . Even if you use soap your hands will still smell . It drives me crazy . But this is just a solid stainless-steel bar and apparently stainless steel has odor-absorbing qualities . You rub it with your hands you dont even need soap but I use soap because I think not using soap is a little weird and it absorbs all the nasty smells . And it never goes bad . It never gets old . You just keep it there by the kitchen sink and it does its job forever . created by two brothers who started their business with their mom which I think is adorable . Ive had this bag for almost seven years and its completely held up . I use it as a carry-on bag when I fly it has a sleeve for a laptop and an interior pocket for a book or Kindle plus an interior pocket on the side for shoes or a wallet . Its just really genius and well-done but also simple and not crazy statement-making . I recommend it to anyone who travels . Also present were some of her favorite glamazons: Gigi and Bella Hadid Cat McNeil Behati Prinsloo and Imaan Hammam with some models sporting rainbow-hued extensions . A classic super moment came from Amber Valletta who closed the show and clutched a white bandana during the finale . And The slogans aside the most empowering element of the collection was its emphasis on real clothing like a sharp purple pantsuit that evoked the 80s but wasnt too costumey and relaxed low-slung trousers . The sporty elements that have found their way into recent collections were here in full force on neon parkas and wet-suit-style tops . This is about as down-to-earth as these glamazons get . during his Senate hearings . Discarding the rights of transgender students is clearly just a warm-up act for a Justice Department that will work hard to dismantle the rights of other minorities including the voting rights of African-Americans and any others who might threaten GOP rule at the ballot box . So radical is Sessions that even a hard-right ideologue like DeVos can seem relatively moderate next to him though only up to a point . Once the Sessions edict prevailed she intervened to get Daddy to back down from his contemplated reversal of President Obamas anti-discrimination protections for LGBT Americans either stayed silent or had no influence this time . Trump wasnt even loyal to poor Jackie Evancho the 16-year-old singer who risked ridicule by performing at his Inaugural and has a transgender sister: Evancho was reduced to Tillersons visit to Mexico this week accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was nothing if not a public confirmation of his irrelevance . Even as he was saying all the appropriate things about the friendship between the United States and Mexico his boss was back in Washington slurring Mexico once again as a conveyor belt for criminals toying with the notion of cutting back American aid to Mexico to pay for the wall and readying a new anti-immigrant edict that would be as toxic to Mexicans as to Muslims . Poor Kelly had to step to a microphone to specifically contradict Trump promising that there would be no mass deportations of illegal immigrants and This dog-and-pony show was meant to show that these two rivals for White House turf were pacific colleagues and that therefore all press reports saying otherwise are fake news . The rare glimpse of Bannon in action revealed two things about him: 1 He could roll over the milquetoast clerk Priebus anytime he wanted to; 2 He looks so unhealthy he may not be around long enough to be on hand for that showdown . was a senior editor at Bannons Breitbart News . Yiannopoulos had also been on the bill at the CPAC conference until the world suddenly rediscovered a taped appearance in which he spoke with genuine feeling about the virtues of pedophilia for underage boys . Presumably Bannon knew of his senior editors thoughts on that topic that incriminating public video dated back to early 2016 . So far Bannons own position on pedophilia remains unknown .
