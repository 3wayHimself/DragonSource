Paul Gus parents were angry and confused . Their son who in 2011 was halfway through a degree in economics and computer science was on the phone telling them he wanted to pursue something called a Thiel Fellowship . As one of 24 uniquely talented teenagers hed get $100000 over two years to start a company he and a classmate had dreamed up . The catch was that hed have to drop out of college . Gus parents had moved from Hebei China to Phoenix when he was 6 years old . Theyd never heard of Peter Thiel the libertarian billionaire whod co-founded PayPal then made prescient and extraordinarily lucrative investments in Facebook Spotify Yelp and other tech high-fliers . As with most Americans immigrant or otherwise their version of the American dream included a college education as the foundation of upward mobility . But as Thiel sees it todays elite universities are overpriced relics holding back innovation and contributing to a technology deficit that will have disastrous economic consequences . He believes gumptious kids like Gu shouldnt spend their late teens and early 20s piling up debt that will push them into gainful but unrewarding jobs . Instead they should pursue radical innovation that will benefit society . Thiel suggested he could do a better job than degree-making institutions by giving bright ambitious adolescents and young adults the freedom to reach for loftier goals . To catalyze their endeavors his fellowship would offer a monthly stipend and opportunities for mentorship business guidance and networking . By taking aim at Americas higher education system Thiel intended to stir up a storm and he did . Harvard President Larry Summers says the idea is the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade . Higher education needs to change Summers adds but using philanthropic dollars to tempt people to drop out of college is a very dangerous idea . Thiel says its Summers and his colleagues who are hawking a mendacious dream . Higher-education costs have increased at twice the rate of inflation and student debt now tops $1 . 3 trillion . The rise in debt has coincided with a decline in business startups by adults under 35creating what a recent study by the Kauffman Foundation calls a lost generation of entrepreneurs . Thiel who predicted the bursting of the tech and housing bubbles believes the education debt bubble will be the next to explode . Theres been an incredible escalation in price without corresponding improvements in the product and yet people still believe that college is just something that you have to do . Whenever something is overvalued and intensely believed thats a sign of a bubble . Part of whats rankling educators like Summers is that Thiels grievances resonate with some of their brightest students . Fellowship officials say that about three-quarters of the 6000 applications they received last year were submitted by students at top-tier schools like Yale Harvard MIT and Stanford . These are kids who have followed competitive but tightly scripted paths that lead to the difficult but somewhat mundane goal of acceptance to a top collegefollowed by a career thats more likely to be remunerative than meaningful . Finance and consulting which claim about a third of Ivy League graduates are examples Thiel likes to cite with scorn . A creative and entrepreneurial subclass of these students arrives on campus only to realize that the institution theyve worked so hard to get into lacks the flexibility these restless brains crave . Like Paul Gu Eden Full Goh heard about the Thiel Fellowship in early 2011 when she was a sophomore at Princeton . A varsity rower and budding electrical engineer Full Goh radiates an energetic self-assuredness much larger than her 4-foot 11-inch frame . At 10 years old she built her first solar car then she began working on an invention that uses gravity-fed water and calibrated bimetallic coils to allow solar panels to track the sunboosting output by 40 percent and as a bonus spitting out clean drinking water . After graduating from her Calgary Alberta high school at 16 she set off for rural Kenya to tweak the prototype . She envisioned the SunSaluter as a sustainable energy source for millions in the developing world . But at Princeton she says her education was getting in the way . I had to fit into a rigid system that wasnt created for people like me . The required courses were slowing me down . I wanted to learn what I needed to develop my ideas and get them out there . In March 2011 Full Goh Gu and 78 other finalists traveled to San Francisco to present their ideas to fellowship judges many of whom were Thiels friends from the tech and venture capital worlds . About half the winning pitches were ambitious science and engineering projects: John Burnham had a proposal to extract minerals from passing asteroids; Laura Deming was set on eliminating age-related disease one of Thiels pet interests . Its theoretically possible said Deming whod entered MITs biology program at 14 for humans to live for hundreds of years . Others seemed more inspired by tech innovators like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg both of whom left Harvard without a degree . The founders of Dell Uber Oracle and many other tech high-fliers all dropped out of college early as did Apple founder Steve Jobs . Jobs became convinced in his freshman year that his degree-path courses at Reed College werent worth what his working-class parents were paying . Once he dropped out he began dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting . Among them was a calligraphy class that would inspire the Macintosh computers emphasis on typographyone of Apples signature strengths . Gu who had an idea for a local-commerce website decided to accept the fellowship over his parents objectionseven though he agreed with them that his chances for entrepreneurial success were low . They thought I was crazy to walk away from an Ivy League diploma says Gu now 26 . But the safe track I was on didnt have much room for growth . I wanted to take on bigger challenges . Gus soft-spoken Yale classmate and business partner Daniel Friedman hesitated to sign on . Professionally Id gain experience and if things went horribly wrong I could go back . The real costs were social: Id be leaving my close friends says Friedman who eventually accepted the fellowship . Unlike most of the other finalists Nick Cammarata was an ambivalent student . I had a 2 . 2 [grade point average] in high school and I missed 60 school days my senior year he says . But Cammarata was ambitious about his projects and precociously self-sufficient . At age 9 he insisted he start paying his parents his share of the household utilities . At 10 he was spending up to 80 hours a week experimenting with algorithmic programming . By 16 hed started a Dropbox competitor that attracted 83 million users in 11 months . Those accomplishments prompted the head of Carnegie Mellon Universitys School of Computer Science to override its admissions requirements and enroll him . But at a sleepover weekend for incoming freshmen Cammarata became disenchanted by his classmates lack of direction and decided to pursue the Thiel Fellowship instead . I wasnt sure what this guy Thiel was up to says Cammarata who had an idea for an app that would enable teachers to create and share interactive lessons on tablets . Was it some kind of experiment ? Whatever it was it seemed a whole lot more interesting than going to college . Peter Thiel has been trying to rewire the world to his liking since he arrived in Silicon Valley as a Stanford University freshman in 1985 . PayPal which he co-founded in 1998 was never intended to be merely a handy replacement for checks and money orders . Its founding vision as he wrote in the libertarian journal After selling the company to eBay for $1 . 5 billion in 2002 Thiel began shopping for other dot-coms that could force change on the existing social and political order and create a new world . In 2004 he was the first outsider to bet on Facebook with a $500000 angel investment that would earn him a reported $400 million . He saw social medias utility in libertarian terms as a means to create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states . More recently Thiel has irked Silicon Valley with his support of Donald Trump and rankled journalists with his behind-the-scenes funding of an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by Terry Bollea better known as Hulk Hogan . The $140 million judgment bankrupted Gawker Media publisher of a tech blog that had nine years earlier outed Thiel as gay . Though vengeance was clearly the motivation with the Gawker lawsuit Thiel often seems to be driven by what PayPal co-founder Max Levchin calls the sheer contrariness of what he is doing . One of his signature questions for fellows and job candidates is: Tell us something about the world that you think is true that most people think is not true . Thiel also believes that society and its most influential subsets could do betterand that he can be a force for positive change . The manifesto of his Founders FundWe wanted flying cars but we got 140 charactersexpresses the venture capitalists frustration with the shallowness of Silicon Valleys ambitions . Thiels jabs at higher education are attacks on a much more vaunted American institution . At one point he considered starting his own university according to Michael Gibson who along with Danielle Strachman was hired to oversee the fellowship program . Thiel dropped the idea because Gibson says it seemed too complicated and too much like surrendering to the system . Thiel wanted his fellowship to be flexible with no constraints on where or how fellows spend their time . Gu Cammarata Full Goh and several other fellows headed to the San Francisco Bay Area within a few months joining the quickening stream of young talent arriving to take a shot at startup stardom . study the average New York City tech founder is a college grad who first spends nearly a decade working for an established company . But the Bay Area increasingly attracts young people who see little reason to get a degree before founding a company or going to work for Google or the other tech giants that no longer require diplomas . That hacker mindsetthat the world is malleable and ripe for innovationcoupled with the areas ever-deepening wells of capital has created something of a post-credential economy in Northern California . The Thiel fellows were ostensibly better-equipped than many of the arrivistes with their $4000 monthly stipends and their benefactors name behind them . But other support was at first scant . It was up to the fellows to find work space and seek out mentors to set goals and figure out how to achieve them . Apart from quarterly check-ins the teenagers had absolute freedom to build their own structure . Gu who had amicably parted with Friedman had a surfeit of enthusiasm but only a rough sense of what his product and company would look like . I was pitching ideas around having lunch with lots of smart people . It was exciting at first but we were losing focus . I was frustrated . I started to wonder why Id dropped out . Away from their circles of family and friends and expected to build companies from scratch several first- and second-year fellows reported problems with depression . I was living in the cheapest place I could find in Silicon Valley coding all day and most of the night says Cammarata who had teamed up with fellows David Merfield and John Marbach to develop the lesson-sharing app which they named Tablo . Id thought Id come out and be mentored by Zuck and [Elon] Musk Cammarata says with a smile but there were no classes and no meaningful mentorships . We had no idea how to build a business . I realized it wasnt what I wanted; I wanted to be in college to party and make friends . Marbach whod left Wake Forest University quickly realized that Silicon Valley has few social spaces for nondrinking minors . I could get access to any CEO or VC which was great but I couldnt find anyone to hang out with . Marbach decided to leave the fellowship and return to Wake Forest . Fellow David Luan went back to Yale . I knew growing a business would take time says Friedman who had shifted to an online-education venture . But after 18 months my friends were getting close to graduationthis big goaland theyd ask me what was going on with my company . It started to get embarrassing . Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa found that 45 percent of undergraduates at 24 institutions showed no significant improvement in a range of skillsincluding critical thinking complex reasoning and writingduring their first two years at college . The authors attributed the poor performance to the distractions of socializing or working and a collegiate culture that doesnt prioritize undergraduate learning . But there are some things colleges do better than any other institution . A campus provides a structured semi-guided transition into adulthood and opens up diverse worlds of people and ideas . A motivated student can learn how to write eloquently or apply quantitative skills to scientific discovery . And a university is a great place to test ones interests and meet lifelong friends mentors and romantic partners . Thiels degreesa B . A . and a J . D . from Stanfordwould seem to have served him well . But the investor who is now worth about $2 . 7 billion says he was guilty of not carefully considering his education . I didnt know what else to do and I didnt want to take responsibility for really thinking about my future . In the 30 years since Thiel was a freshman college has become a much more expensive place to find oneself . For some people its still worth it he says . But a lot of graduates cant get good jobs; theyre saddled with debt and moving back home with their parents . People are starting to see that something has gone wrong . Skipping college to try to build the next Uber or Airbnb might seem a seductive option but for every Zuckerberg or Jobs there are thousands of college quitters whose big ideas sputter . America's 30 million college dropouts are much more likely than graduates to be unemployed and living in poverty . Though the return on a higher-education investment may be declining adults without degrees earn on average only $23900 per yearless than half the average of college graduates . Whats missing from the fellowship narrative says second-year Thiel fellow Dylan Field who left Brown University after his junior year is that college is very useful for a lot of people . I actually loved it . But I wanted to build a business and the fellowship was a way to accelerate that . A former child actor who grew up in Californias Sonoma County Field attended a technology-focused high schoolThe robotics team was like the football team he saysand had college internships at LinkedIn and OReilly Media . During a summer stint at Flipbook he came up with an audacious plan to take on software giant Adobe by building a better and cheaper suite of creative tools for designers . As Field and other second-year fellows moved to the Bay Area bonds began to build . Cammarata Deming and others rented a big house in Palo Alto . Starting with five people the group grew to eight or nine housemates . We had a 6-foot-4 guy living in a closet at one point Cammarata says . That was my pseudo-dorm experience complete with the soul-searching 2 a . m . conversations . Things started to get fun at that point . The program began adding structure to fill some of the college-like gaps . Incoming fellows got help finding group housing in San Francisco and Silicon Valley and the fellowship started sponsoring more seminars dinners and mixers where fellows could mingle with one another and with tech-industry titans and angel investors . They also brought in a psychologist to help those who were struggling emotionally . We underestimated how important community would be for the fellows Thiel says . That was our biggest mistake the first year . game and software developer Gigster . Wed be up on a rooftop of a mansion on a mountain hobnobbing with the billionaires who built Silicon Valley Cammarata says and these guys seemed so thrilled to be interacting with people so young . They all wanted to help to get involved . Tablo was the first company founded during the fellowship to be sold . Momentum was building for other fellows too . Field quickly raised $4 million for his company Figma . Gu who had abandoned his original idea crossed paths with two Google Enterprise executives looking for their next project . The three teamed up and raised a $1 . 75 million seed round for a lending platform on which investors back young up-and-comersa Kickstarter for people as Gu put it . That idea eventually morphed into Upstart which loans money using innovative algorithms Gu developed to evaluate earning potential and other factors rather than traditional credit scores . Gu would eventually locate what he says is a very meaningful portion of our investors through fellowship networks . By imitating aspects of the college experience the fellowship has begun to look a little more like the institutions its founder railed against . There are signs the influence has flowed in the opposite direction as well . Over the past six years universities that have lost students to the Thiel Fellowship or Y-Combinator an early-stage tech incubator in which Thiel is a partner have introduced an array of options to support students entrepreneurial passions while keeping them on campus . Harvards Innovation Lab i-lab serves as a financing and mentoring resource for students who are pursuing innovative startups and the Yale Entrepreneurial Institutes Innovation Fund offers up to $100000 to fledgling companies . David Luan who left the Thiel Fellowship after one year turned to Yales fund to help finance his visual-analysis software company Dextro . Wharton Columbia Northwestern and several state universities have also started incubator and accelerator programs . To Thiel these moves dont get at what he sees as higher educations underlying problems: the still-rising costs the questionable value the exclusivity . The elite universities do some good things he says but the core lie they tell is that their version of an education is an inherently positive thing that everyone has access to . The reality says Thiel is theyre running a Studio 54 nightclub with a long line outside and a few people inside dancing . If Harvard wanted more of the world to benefit they could open it up franchise it to reach more people . Of course any Harvard president who suggested that would find an alumni lynch mob at his door . Their sense of identity comes from exclusion . And yet Thiel doubts he will expand his program beyond the current limit of 30 new fellows per year . We have to be careful for it not to become just another monolithic credentialing system . With a small group were able to work with them individually and create specific opportunities and make meaningful connections to people they need to meet . The Thiel pedigree almost guarantees that investors will at least listen to fellows pitchesand very often they respond favorably . By the third year Gus Upstart had raised a $6 million series A round and had 10 employees . Dylan Field brought in another $14 million and expanded his Figma team to 14 designers engineers and marketing people . With the release of a beta version the design community began to buzz about Figmas real-time collaborative editing capabilities a feature that gave it a leg up on Adobe . Full Goh whod decided to incorporate SunSaluter as a nonprofit pulled in $500000 in grants and racked up a million air miles as she set up distribution and manufacturing bases in Africa and India . Other fellows who became adept at raising money struggled at running a business . Stanford dropout Tom Curriers company which managed urban co-living properties collapsed after two years forcing evictions . Andrew Hsuwho at 19 had been a fourth-year Ph . D . candidate in neuroscience at Stanfordraised $1 . 5 million from heavy hitters like Google Ventures for his educational gaming startup Airy Labs which laid off most of its 20 employees in 2012 amid accusations that the company was a sweatshop that was actually run by Hsus parents . Fellows now must keep the programs staff updated on revenue expenses and cash flow . We want to know so we can help them if they need to step on the gas and grow faster or if theyve only got six months cash left says Jack Abraham who came on as executive director when Gibson and Strachman left to start a venture fund to meet the capital needs of fellowship alumni and other misfit young entrepreneurs . Abraham has also developed a comprehensive mentoring program to help fellows with some of the bigger challenges of growing a company including fundraising team building and user acquisition . By far the biggest change is in the types of projects new fellows are bringing in . Despite Thiels stated goal of spurring advances in areas like biomedical technology transportation and energy each successive class has looked increasingly like the programs creator and Silicon Valley . There are few ambitious hard-science projectsnuclear fusion energy cancer cures immunotherapythat might jump-start the radical innovation Thiel envisioned when he founded the program . We started with the perspective that we needed more scientific breakthroughs but in STEM [science technology engineering and math] its harder to start something independently he says . Its much easier with software where yourself and a computer can do it with a readily available amount of financing . Now we think about not just whether an applicants idea is inspiring and can change the world but also whether its feasible and has a clear path forward to market . Some of the early fellows have made impressive if incremental strides in the fields of photonics nanotechnology and medicine but the biggest hits have been the most pedestrian . Harvard dropout Ben Yus Sprayable caffeine is tearing up the market and investors have sunk tens of millions of dollars into Vitalik Buterins cryptocurrency projects . James Proud raised roughly $40 million for Hello which makes the Sense sleep tracker one of several high-tech alarm clocks now hitting the market . In India Ritesh Agarwal has raised more than $225 million to build an online marketplace for branded budget hotels . What that shows says Bill Aulet who directs MITs Global Founders' Skills Accelerator is that the Thiel Fellowship is fine if you want to do the next Red Bull or dating app or Uberfication but maybe not if you want to solve cancer or fundamentally change the world . Whether intentional or not one practical result of the fellowship has been its role as a farm team for Thiel Inc . Friedmans company Thinkful was the first to get capital from Thiel through his FF Angel venture capital fund . Since then Thiels funds have invested in Gus Upstart and Thomas Sohmerss REX Computing which designs energy-efficient chips for supercomputing applications . Thiel money has gone into Clay Allsopps Propeller which creates tools for building mobile apps and which was acquired in 2014 by Palantir Technologies the secretive data-analysis company co-founded by Thiel . There are undoubtedly others: When I asked Deming if Thiel or one of his funds had invested in her biotech-focused Longevity Fund or her immunotherapy company Alexo Therapeutics she said Im not sure I can say that . But I guess you can guess . Full Goh and other fellows have also taken jobs at Palantir and served as consultants to the Founders Fund . We try to be very careful to keep a super-bright line between nonprofit and for-profit he said . If there were questions about whether a person whos underwriting a nonprofit somehow profits on the back end it would open you up to charges of it being somehow self-serving . Our funds don't actually lead the investments and my investments are very passive a very small part . Beyond the impressive numbersthe 138 Thiel fellows have collectively raised some $450 million in investments and created $2 . 5 billion in equity value more than most college endowmentsThiel believes the fellowship has succeeded in promoting entrepreneurship as a viable alternative to college . Nowadays entrepreneurship is a line you put on your rsum he says . But Thiel says the most important gauge of the programs success is whether it has positively affected the lives of the fellows . Of the 22 fellows I spoke witheven those who left the program earlyall but one said emphatically that it had . None of them counted their business success as their greatest gain though . They claimed that theyd learned far more doing real work and solving real problems than they would have if theyd spent the time in college . Whether Thiels experiment demonstrates a viable alternative to higher education is debatable . The extra time money and connections certainly accelerated the success of many of this handpicked group of high-achieving outliersbut one could argue that most would have done very well for themselves eventually with or without their billionaire patron . Thiels fellowship hasnt given us flying cars or asteroid mining but it has provoked a long-overdue discussion about the value of higher educationand that may well be its biggest service to society . Even if it turns out to be just a $16 million PR campaign to get parents to think more cogently about their investments in their children's futures says Dale Stephens Id say its been tremendously successful . In the six years since the fellowship began the range of educational alternatives has exploded . With traditional institutions slow to meet the demands of a new generation of students new players are taking advantage of more accessible technology and changing the way education is conceived and delivered . Some are narrowly focused on skills acquisition offering a tech-era update to the vocational school tradition that can serve as either a substitute or a practical complement to a liberal arts education . More than 40 million students have taken online interactive computer-coding courses from Code Academy co-founded by a Columbia University dropout and Udemy . Other booming upstarts such as General Assembly and Hack Reactor offer a range of online options and bricks-and-mortar boot camps that promise to make a programmer employable in 12 intense weeks for about $15000 . Among the broader and deeper educational options that are emerging some of the most interesting have come from Thiel fellows . Friedmans company Thinkful personalizes distance learning for information technology professionals by combining online lessons with one-on-one mentorship by experienced coders . Stephenss wildly successful UnCollege offers structured gap-year programs for young people who want to drive their own education explore and make a splash in the world . What separates these new options from traditional learning paradigms is their la carte nature: Students rather than administrators choose what to study . Its the great unbundling says Gibson . Before universities had it all tied up in one package . Now that there are cheaper and more relevant alternatives for learning people are breaking out of these super-narrow tracks . You will start to see fewer people willing to play by the old bureaucratic arbitrary rules . Gu whose online loan platform has raised more than $53 million and employs 100 people says his parents have finally begun to accept that their son will never get an Ivy League diploma . Of the 43 fellows in the first two classes Gu is one of 25 who stayed out of college and continued working on their own companies or projects . Six went to work for established tech companies some through acquisitions . Over the six-year life of the fellowship only 12 of the 138 fellows have returned to college . Among those dozen returnees Full Gohs decision to go back to Princeton was perhaps the most surprising . But Full Goh whose SunSaluter is now boosting solar electricity output in 18 countries in Asia and Africa did it on her own terms . I strategically picked only the classes I wanted to take to give me the technical fluency I wanted and to minimize my time on campus . The Democratic party took a major stride Saturday in its effort to reorient itself in the era of Donald Trump . In a hotly contested vote party members tapped former Labor Secretary Tom Perez to be the next Democratic National Committee DNC chairman topping his closet rival Congressman Keith Ellison after winning a majority of the 442 votes on the second round of balloting . The party faithful meeting inAtlanta thenpromptly elected Ellison deputy chair . Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and his allies had vocally rallied behind Ellison touting him as the heir apparent to the liberal movement that Sanders started in last year's Democratic presidential primary . They sought to portray Perez as part of the establishment given his ties to the Obama administration and as one of the vice presidential candidates on presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's shortlist . While Sanders congratulated Perez in a statement shortly after the electionhe also warned the new party chair that[[Q-1]]The reality is Perez is a pathbreaker in his own right becoming the first Latino to lead the Democratic party . And his platform was nearly indistinguishable from Ellison's during the several-months-long campaign for chairman . Both men like the other eight candidates running emphasized organizing and reconnecting with the party's grassroots a glaring weakness in their 2016 defeats . Thousandsof those people however are now turning out to protest Trump and his policies a sign of the energy on the left that Democrats hope to capitalize on in the years ahead . His goal as party chair Perez said in his opening remarks is [[Q-2]] Like his fellow candidates Perez emphasized the need for Democrats to contest races up and down the ballot and all around the country from school board to Congress . [[Q-3]] Perez said an implicitrebuke of the party during its eight years under President Obama . That was a recurring theme throughout the day and the whole campaign . While Democrats were careful to laud Obama's ability to bring together a national coalition of voters one that did not show up with the same force for Clinton the last president also sapped the party of much of its local organizing strength . Obama officials kept much of their national field workdata and organizing capacity separate from the DNC as part ofOrganizing for America a campaign-like operation run by allies . The result: The party is now staring at an electoral deficit not seen since the 1920s . Not only isTrump in the White House but Republicans control the House and Senate as well . Since 2008 Democrats also have lost more than 1000 state legislative seats and a dozen governors mansions . At the most basic level the next DNC chairmans task is to start to claw back some of those posts . They'll have some prime opportunities in the coming round of elections particularly in state races . Thirty-six states are holding gubernatorial el`ections in November 2018 . Along with state legislative races those contests will determine who gets to draw district lines after the next Census in 2020 . The challenge for Perez will be how to take a party seething under Trump's reign but struggling to identify a clear unifying message . He and Ellisonboth civil rights attorneys by trainingpromised to reenergize the partyand regain the trust of those alienated by a divisive 2016 primary when hacked emails revealed DNC staff actively working to help the Clinton campaign and push Sanders out . But neither offered many specifics on what he would actually do in the post . The clearest agenda was actually laid out by a young red state politician Pete Buttigieg who's in his second term as mayor of South Bend Indiana . Buttigieg was considered a dark horse candidate for the post after impressing senior officials with his eloquence and campaign pitch . Buthe dropped out Saturday before the voting began saying it was clear he did not have the votes . He did not endorse either Perez or Ellison . In his remarks to the party faithful Buttigieg urged Democrats to bring people together around their values not their various identities . And he recommended the party [[Q-4]]The report from the Department of Homeland Security did not find significant domestic terror threats from the nations that were included in the banSyria Iraq Iran Yemen Libya Somalia Sudanand concluded that [[Q-5]] The Trump team has promised a revised travel and refugee ban after its initial executive order was blockedby the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after days of confusion and detentions at the nation's airports . The president repeatedly blasted the ruling as political but the administration has thus far declined to contest it in court preferring to draft a new temporary travel and refugee ban that addresses the Constitutional questions cited by the Ninth Circuit . The new executive order is reportedly complete and could be issued in the coming days . Trump and the Department of Justice had argued that the order was necessary to preserve national security an argument that the Ninth Circuit found fault with . The rejected DHS report doesn't add much credence to that argument with only two of the seven countries in Trump's order making the list of the top countries for individuals engaged in terror activities in the U .

In his wildly cheered address here Trump kept talking about defending the flag a faint reference to some protesters in 2016 . Never mind that the sainted Justice Antonin Scalia had been the deciding vote striking down a law banning flag burning . Those issues will continue to percolate but attention is going to turn to the practical lives of the forgotten man . He made Trump and can break him . On his way to a top altitude of more than 62 miles test pilot Mike Melvill heard what he described as a tremendous bang from the engine of SpaceShipOne . Thankfully things ended well on that June day in 2004 with Melvill landing safely in the Mojave Desert and entering the history books as the first private sector astronaut to reach outer space . Although the source of that distressingly loud noise was not determined there was speculation within the aerospace industry that rocket fuel had become jammed in the engine . For a second or two the astronaut didnt know whether the hunk of fuel was going to go out the nozzle or whether the combustion chamber was going to explode says Sid Gutierrez a former test pilot and astronaut . It wound up going out the nozzle so life was good for him that day . Unlike most rocket fuel which is either solid or liquid NASAs current standard Rocket Crafterss is a hybrid: part solid part liquid . The solid is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS . Its the material Legos are made from and surprisingly also makes for decent rocket fuel . The liquid is nitrous oxide familiar to most Americans from whipped cream cans or the dentists chair but used in this case to aid combustion . The two ingredients are kept in different chambers of the rocket engine and gradually combined to produce thrust . Because the ABS and nitrous oxide are held separately and in different forms solid and liquid the odds of their accidental mixture and detonation are exceedingly low . The use of hybrid fuel also necessitates a hybrid engine which is relatively simpler and thus less expensive than a liquid-fueled engine . But the choice of hybrid fuel isnt where Rocket Crafterss biggest innovation lies . Besides being the stuff of Legos ABS is also one of the primary materials used by 3-D printers . This allows Rocket Crafters to produce solid fuel grains in custom-designed shapes and with precisely placed additives . The geometric design increases each 8-foot-long grains stiffness which prevents vibrations that can rattle dangerously throughout the engine while the additives deliver more energy improving performance while maintaining consistency . Up until now performance and consistency have been hybrid fuels biggest hurdles to widespread adoption . Rocket Crafters has big plans for its newly patented fuel . Eventually it will be at the heart of the Intrepid-1 the companys line of launchers intended to deliver communications and imaging satellites into orbit with greater precision than is currently possible . Right now small satellites blast off 60 at a time on large rockets meaning companies must essentially carpool making compromises on where and when their satellites launch . The Intrepid-1 is sized to deliver single satellites at a fraction of the cost . On a longer timeline Gutierrez is hoping that advancements in safety cost and reliability will make spaceflight accessible to consumers as tourists . A satellite doesnt get a vote as to what it flies on he acknowledges but people do and they want to fly on the safest thing possible . a Russian nuclear icebreaker with enormous shark teeth painted on its bow rammed through the thick ice at the North Pole as a research vessel followed behind it firing its seismic guns . Its multiyear mission: find oil and natural gas and help claim the Arctic sea bottom in Moscows name . In January as Russian scientists were finalizing the test results one of the missions leaders was elated as he stood before a rapt audience in Troms a stunningly beautiful Arctic city in Norway . We assure you there is oil there said Gennady Ivanov of Russias Marine Arctic Geological Expedition . And the oil is recoverable he noted later in response to a question . U . S . and European oil companies have long fantasized about tapping the Arctics abundant reserves; the U . S . Geological Survey estimates they make up to 13 percent of the worlds undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its natural gas . Now as rising temperatures cause more ice to melt which is clearing Arctic seas the trillion-dollar race to own the regions riches is on . In 2012 Russia tried to claim 460000 square miles of Arctic ocean flooran area the size of France and Spainas national territory . Moscow did so as part of a treaty called the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which allows countries to expand the undersea area where they own mineral rights beyond the currently recognized 200-mile limit . The catch ? Russia must prove to a committee of international scientists based at the United Nations that the area is an extension of its continental shelf . The committee initially rejected Moscows claim sending Russian scientists back to the High North to search for more evidence . Ivanov now insists the proof exists . If hes right it will help Russian President Vladimir Putin achieve two of his primary Arctic goals: to boost his countrys massive oil and natural gas reserves and to encourage commercial shipping through an Arctic shortcut between European and Asian ports . Even as Moscow waits for the science committees decision about the North Pole its Arctic energy push is yielding results . Russian land-based oil and natural gas production in the Arctic is peaking year after year . In January Russias state-controlled Gazprom Neft company announced that four oil wells are up and running at the Prirazlomnoye fields in the Arctic Pechora Sea and the company plans to put 28 more online . Meanwhile a new $27 billion liquid natural gas plant based in the Arctic and jointly funded by Russian Chinese and French energy companies is moving gas south to Europe through a new 786-mile-long pipeline . Once considered too remote and dangerous for commerce the Arctic is about to get a lot more crowded . Norway is expanding its search for oil in the region and recently offered a new round of oil leases in the Barents Sea farther north than ever before . Despite the challenges of High North drilling an official from the Norwegian oil and gas association told Profit has been less of an incentive thus far in the U . S . which has been much more cautious in the far north . President Barack Obama blocked most federal Arctic offshore areas from exploration in December citing environmental concerns . Those include possible oil spills which could damage or scare away marine life some of which local Iupiat Eskimos rely on for food and cultural identity . Now Donald Trump might try to reverse Obamas executive action and Alaskas congressional delegation is lobbying for him to open up more of the American Arcticon- and offshoreto oil exploration . Regardless of what Trump decides some fear that competition between the great powers over trade routes and natural resources could get out of hand . Already there are signs of tension . In May 2015 Russia unleashed 250 aircraft and 12000 troops in a massive Arctic war games exercise in response to a smaller NATO maneuver . Last month the U . S . a NATO member stationed 300 Marines in Norway full time . Meanwhile Russia has changed its war game strategy . It no longer offers advance warning when an exercise is plannedsomething that has unsettled its NATO neighbors up north . One of those countries Denmark has like Russia claimed the North Pole sea bottom under the Law of the Sea treaty . Canada which is also in NATO will file a claim by 2018 which is expected to include the North Pole too . If that happens it is possible that all three countries will be able to prove the area is an extension of their continental shelves . The treaty formally known as the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea calls for the owners of legitimate overlapping claims to work out boundaries among themselves . Which is perhaps one reason why Russian military planners have identified the Arctic as a likely place for future wars . The Russian political and military leadership has systematically argued that there will be an acute shortage of energy resources worldwide which may lead to conflict and that the West led by the United States may attempt to seize Russias oil and gas says Katarzyna Zysk an associate professor at the Norwegian Defence University College who specializes in Russian defense policy . But not everyone believes a clash is inevitable . American and European diplomats routinely assure reporters that Russia and the other Arctic nationsthe U . S . Canada Norway Sweden Finland Denmark and Icelandcontinue to cooperate in the High North especially on shipping and search and rescue efforts despite tensions elsewhere . They also proudly point to an agreement signed in 2010 by Norway and Russia that peacefully resolved a maritime Arctic border dispute in the Barents Sea . If that happens the Kremlin is far better prepared for outright conflict or plain old competition . Moscow not only has more than 40 icebreakers; its in the middle of the largest Arctic military push since the Cold War . Russia has more Arctic bases than any country and is building more including 13 new airfields and 10 Arctic-based air defense radar stations scheduled to be in operation by the end of this year . Russia has also formed a new brigade trained in Arctic warfare and is constructing 16 deep-water ports and 13 airfields in the region . The way Lo sees it the Russian response to NATO war games is You think you can frighten us buster ? We can always escalate . The U . S . however is poorly prepared to react to any sort of challenge or emergencyand its still unclear how the Trump administration will change Americas Arctic policy . Washington has only two icebreakers both old and only one can break through heavy ice . The country has no concrete plans to build more . We need Arctic ports says the State Departments top Arctic diplomat David Balton . Were not prepared in terms of oil spill response or pollution . In the event of a shipping mishap we have very little search and rescue assets nearby . The U . S . is also the only Arctic nation that hasnt ratified the Law of the Sea treaty . It has no representatives on the scientific committee analyzing claims and no way to make its own even though under treaty rules the U . S . could possibly enlarge its undersea territory off the coast of Alaska by an area about the size of California . If the treaty process were a baseball game the U . S . wouldnt be on the field in the stands even in the parking lot Coast Guard Rear Admiral Gene Brooks told me in 2010 . Seven years later there has been little progress toward ratifying the treaty despite support from both the Obama and George W . Bush administrations the Navy environmental groups shippers and oil companies . A small group of Republicans keep blocking it in the Senate because they dont want to participate in any international agreement they believe will give foreign bodies power over American policy .
