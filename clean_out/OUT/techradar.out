Further down the list there's a phone apparently launching with a 5 . 2-inch 1080p screen 4GB of RAM 64GB of storage a 23MP main camera and a 16MP front-facing one and a handset listed as having a 5 . 0-inch 720p display 3GB of RAM 32GB of storage a 16MP rear camera and an 8MP front-facing one . There have been foldable concept and prototype phones popping up for years and with curved displays now a mainstream thing this is the obvious next step . If a commercially available folding phone launches at MWC it could easily be one of the highlights of the show . Hopefully at MWC 2017 well see high-profile handsets that put a long-lasting battery ahead of ever slimmer designs . Wireless and fast charging have become more common features in recent years but theyre no substitute for a battery that simply doesnt need charging as often . MWC 2017 will only be as memorable as the phones that make an appearance so it would be great to see a wide range of flagships . This would also give prospective buyers a clear view of their options rather than making them wait for other flagships to be announced later in the year or risk missing out . The circuit board is the canary in this case; Waymo apparently learned about the theft when it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its LIDAR parts suppliers . The email had an attachment purporting to show an Uber LIDAR system but Waymo recognized the design as its own . The filing says Waymo's LIDAR can pick up hazards a human may not detect and calls its sensors the most advanced and cost-effective around . It credits its LIDAR for allowing one of its steering-wheel-and-foot-pedal-less cars to complete a fully autonomous journey on public roads . Technically speaking Samsung's QLED TVs are not QLED at all well at least in the way that we understand the term . A 'proper' quantum light-emitting diode element emits its own light the clue is in the name whereas Samsung's latest TVs use a separate LCD backlight and an edge-lit backlight at that just like any other LED-LCD TV . So where the QLED moniker comes from we're not sure . Its complicated but hang in there with us . So to start all QLED TVs have a quantum dot filter . This year theres a new refined aluminium compound that help make the dots more efficient and therefore brighter and more effective at passing pass light through which creates wider and more accurate colour . Theyre so bright in fact that Samsung's QLED TVs can manage anywhere between 1500 nits to 2000 nits brightness . Considering 1000 nits is needed to produce HDR that's proper bright though exactly how anyone could stand the glare of 2000 nits we're not sure . Sunglasses anyone ? Beyond the 'paradigm shift' hyperbole of Samsung's marketing it's really important to understand that QLED isn't really anything new at all . In fact it's really nothing more than the latest possibly among the last technically possible tweaks to existing LED-LCD technology that's dominated bigscreen TVs for the last decade . QLED's innovations deeper blacks better colours and wider viewing angles tackle three traditional problems of LED and LCD technology but they're the same problems that are addressed year in year out by TV makers . Only upcoming reviews will reveal if in fact QLED is a significant step forward from traditional LED-LCD screens but chances are good that we'll see some real improvements in these areas with Samsung's new sets . There's no doubt that QLED for now has an advantage in terms of brightness so in theory may better handle HDR content though might just as easily overcook it but if you're looking for a 'paradigm shift' in picture quality and the next-gen display technology OLED is still the frontrunner . The latter uses individually lit pixels to achieve better contrast ratio and richer blacks that LED-LCD will never be able to hit quantum dot filter or no . are essentially the same thing; the new messaging is more about marketing than technology although the jump from 1000 nits on the top-end SUHD TVs to 1500 to 2000 nits on the flagship QLED TVs is perhaps more revolutionary than it seems at first . Put simply for a buying public still getting to grips with what UHD is SUHD just proved too confusing so Samsung has dropped it . It also probably didn't help that the 'S' in SUHD didn't really mean anything . . . although we're not convinced that QLED is much clearer . Both the Q9 and Q8 models will also have an 'invisible connection' cable that links the display to a hub that stores the HDMI slots . A bigger contribution to the 'clutter-free' concept behind the QLED TVs' design are the easel-style Studio Stand and small swivel-base Gravity Stand . Samsung's QLED TVs are claimed to be all about the brightest possible most accurate coloured images pictures which therefore work with all kinds of content in all kinds of lighting conditions . Although we can't yet confirm Samsung's claims that its QLED TVs are the brightest and best around our upcoming reviews will confirm or deny that they do appear to be as much about design and flexibility of installation as about picture quality . That all seems a decent package for the living room but whether you should buy a QLED TV will ultimately come down to price . And here comes the crux of the matter; will QLED TVs be cheaper than OLED TVs ? They may need to be to stand a chance but is Samsung really going to make itself a cut-price brand ? We seriously doubt it . Expect oodles of marketing that make QLED seem a better option than OLED though whether it is or not only time will tell .

Can a tablet really replace your laptop or home PC ? That's still up for debate but the best tablet trying to make that happen is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and it does a fine job with the full blown version of Windows 10 an integrated kickstand and optional keyboard attachment . Great for for creative professionals students and everyday folks alike it's only the premium price that pushes it down the list but if you're willing to pay for it you're getting a lot of power Youre either going to immediately fall in love with the Kilburns design or scoff and dismiss it as a product of pure nostalgia . If you fall into the later camp we urge you to turn the knobs touch the brushed metal finishing and velvet strap to see if you change your mind . The speaker is styled after Marshalls iconic guitar amps and features two tweeters and a single woofer crammed its rather large 242 x 140 x 140mm chassis . Weighing in at 3 kg 6 . 6 lbs this isnt a speaker youll want to take with you on a road trip but what you sacrifice in portability you gain in performance . On top youll find all of the controls and inputs which are finished in brushed metal . The controls youll find here are both gorgeous and a pleasure to use featuring just the right resistance that evokes vintage audio gear while still having all the modern conveniences like a Bluetooth pairing button . But heres where we found a weird quirk: in order to charge the Kilburn you have to plug the power cord into the wall and turn the speaker on . Youll also need to use the included IEC C7 power cable to charge as there are no USB ports whatsoever . This means the Kilburn wont charge your phone either . Since the Marshall Kilburn has independent bass and treble controls its hard to comment on the neutrality of the speaker as users can tailor the sound to their tastes . For our tests we set the bass and treble to 50% and the Kilburn blew us away with powerful bass shimmering highs and a good sense of space . Battery life is rated for 20 hours of playback and our testing found that number to be spot on . Should you find that your battery seems to be holding less charge than it once did one neat feature Marshall built into the Kilburn is the ability to replace its battery most competing speakers are sealed so once the battery dies you have to chuck the entire speaker . Throughout our week of testing we fell in love with the Kilburns design feel and pristine sound quality . Theres no other portable Bluetooth speaker on the market quite like it . Its a head turner and conversation piece . Its a piece of audio art that youll be proud to show off to your friends during a party . In a sea of look-alike speakers that all sound fairly good the Marshall Kilburn separates itself from the pack with its vintage styling and killer sound . If design and audio performance are your two most important criteria for a Bluetooth speaker and they should be the Kilburn is near perfect .
