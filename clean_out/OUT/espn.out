No . 4 Arizona is about to host No . 5 UCLA on ESPN . The ViewFromVegas is the Wildcats are 2 . 5-point home favorites . Later also on ESPN No . 1 Gonzaga goes for an undefeated regular season against BYU . The Bulldogs are 20 . 5-point home favorites and are also an NCAA-best 20-5-1 ATS . Crisis fully averted: Lonzo Ball has played every minute of the second half for UCLA . He's up to 11 rebounds and five assists to go with four points . One Pac-12 assistant coach told me this week he'd much rather try to make Ball a scorer than have him facilitating the offense . UCLA guard Lonzo Ball re-entered game after apparently landing on Isaac Hamilton's foot . He was holding his right ankle when he was on the bench . Ball didn't look like he was going full speed when he did play the last minute-plus and it could only get worse if being inactive during halftime causes his ankle to tighten up . UCLA size advantage over Arizona State is almost unfair . TJ Leaf with 10 of team's first 14 points . Bruins already with 6 offensive rebounds -- Sun Devils have just six total -- and 8 second chance points . It's compensated for UCLA otherwise going through the motions 5 turnovers looking ahead to showdown with ArizonaFrom his perch next to Lakers executives Joey and Jesse Buss Magic Johnson munched on popcorn Friday and surveyed his young rebuilding squad play its first game since he ascended from a nebulous advisory position to president of basketball operations in a dramatic in-house bloodletting earlier this week that shook the franchise's foundation and the NBA landscape . Midway through the second quarter Johnson joined the in-game broadcast on Spectrum SportsNet and after preaching patience with repairing a team that has the NBAs third-worst record and has missed the playoffs for three consecutive seasons he headed toward a nearby tunnel . Johnson oozes charisma not to mention the legendary clout that comes with being one of the most exciting athletes in history -- winning five championships achieving Basketball Hall of Fame status and putting together one of the most successful nonsports rsums of any player ever . But the task ahead of him is staggering -- a yearslong venture at least -- and his lack of front-office experience justifiably gives many pause as to whether he is fully equipped to make the Lakers great again no matter his other credentials or what he tweets or boasts during national media tours . Still Johnson is the first to admit that he is up against a monumental feat that there will need to be baby steps before giant leaps . On Thursday night Johnson took several members of the teams coaching staff and front office to dinner at Mahogany Prime Steakhouse a few blocks from their downtown Oklahoma City hotel to lay out his vision and discuss ideas . Walton said the Lakers would love to have Johnson around as much as possible and so far Johnson has attended practices and even worked with players on individual moves . But Johnson likely wont attend many road games beyond Friday which was a statement appearance given the teams massive shakeup . As for losing the Lakers wont have to try much because they simply arent talented or experienced enough to even be competitive most nights especially in the Western Conference . In other words no [[Q-1]] is necessary . But all those defeats will come in handy during the NBA draft lottery on May 16 as the Lakers are praying theyll be able to keep a top-three protected first-round draft pick . The outcome of that crucial draft lottery will help shape the Lakers immediate future though their next 23 games are key for their young core to gain valuable experience and chemistry and to develop what Johnson hopes as he said on Friday's broadcast is an identity . As Chelsea have surged clear of a pack of faltering rivals at the top of the Premier League and the likes of Pep Guardiola Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger have taken turns to proclaim them champions-in-waiting the zeal of Antonio Conte's pleas for concentration has increased . On this evidence his players are listening . Despite being caused considerable discomfort by a resurgent Swansea City side at Stamford Bridge Chelsea continue to stave off the twin vices of anxiety and complacency that can plague so many teams that lead from the front . The omnipresent N'Golo Kante ensured that Swansea barely escaped their own half in the early moments and when Cesc Fabregas broke the deadlock on 19 minutes darting into the penalty area to control Pedro Rodriguez's pass and poke the ball into the far corner a 12th home win of the season felt inevitable . Fernando Llorente's header on the stroke of halftime was the kind of sucker-punch Chelsea have more regularly doled out to opponents since September but the sense of deflation around Stamford Bridge was immediately remedied by the scheduled appearance of Frank Lampard on the pitch at the interval . Swansea showed greater ambition after halftime and for a spell roars of belief were displaced by groans of exasperation around the stands as the visitors gained a foothold . As so often in recent weeks however Pedro was the man to settle the nerves and switch the momentum . Receiving a pass from Fabregas the winger turned infield and hit a curling bouncing shot from 25 yards that fooled Lukasz Fabianski and nestled in the far corner . Pedro now has 11 goals in 19 matches since derailing Mourinho's game plan inside 30 seconds on this ground in October many of them crucial . Few teams have played as well at Stamford Bridge this season as Swansea but Chelsea continue to dispatch capable Premier League opponents convincingly even when below their best . The gap is 11 points now and the chasing pack have no cause for optimism . On the day when Stamford Bridge welcomed back Lampard it was Fabregas who delivered the most fitting tribute . For much of the afternoon the Spaniard appeared to be channeling the spirit of the greatest goalscoring midfielder of his generation in addition to displaying his more trademark gifts . The Spaniard's first late surge into the penalty area was his most effective but his attacking ambition tormented the Swansea defence throughout . Soon after his bouncing shot was tipped wide by Fabianski while after halftime only the crossbar denied him . Conte's benching of Fabregas for Kante and Matic this season has understandably prompted speculation over the former Arsenal captain's future and when he spoke of his frustration at the rise of power over talent in modern football recently his words seemed those of a man aware that the game might be leaving him behind . But while Chelsea's midfield might be more physically imposing without Fabregas it is undeniably still more dangerous with him . His ability to control the tempo and switch the point of attack gives Conte's team more possibilities while his set-piece deliveries -- uncharacteristically poor on Saturday -- provide another less heralded weapon . When Paul Clement was appointed Swansea manager at the beginning of January reservations about his ability to succeed in the Premier League were compounded by a nightmarish run of fixtures that pitted them against Arsenal Liverpool Manchester City and Chelsea within the space of seven games . Swansea had taken 13 points prior to visiting Stamford Bridge and until Pedro beat Fabianski looked good value to repeat the draw they earned against Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium in September -- and might have got more had Cesar Azpilicueta been penalised for a handball in the penalty area . Chelsea did not struggle for chances in either half at Stamford Bridge but a combination of poor finishing and dogged last-ditch defending kept Swansea in the match while Llorente further underlined why Conte was interested in signing him in January . Despite their defeat Swansea sit three points above the relegation zone and their next four matches are against Burnley Hull City Bournemouth and Middlesbrough . Even if Leicester City's underachieving players rediscover some form now Claudio Ranieri is gone Clement's team have the belief and momentum to be confident that it won't be at the expense of them . [[Q-2]]The message there was 'Hit the ball on the nose . Get your hits . Let's play a good solid game . ' Here it's the other way . It's 'Make good pitches . Don't walk anybody . Be fundamentally sound and let's go beat the other team . ' For me it's sort of the opposite of what I dealt with before which is exciting . ''In their first 24 seasons the Rockies tried Don Baylor Jim Leyland Buddy Bell Clint Hurdle Jim Tracy and Walt Weiss in the manager's seat and ranked last or next to last in the National League in ERA 18 times . Now they'll see if a crafty left-hander can solve the Coors Field Rubik's Cube . Black who won 121 games over 15 big league seasons on the mound joins Boston's John Farrell and Cincinnati's and invested money in high draft picks who failed to pan out . They focused on sinkerballers for a while avoided curveballers and got innovative in 2012 when they tried a four-man rotation and limited each starter to 75 innings .

''The early signs for the young starters are encouraging .

The foursome chats for 10 or 15 minutes about who would build the cars and engines and who the crew chief might be . Johnson wasn't pleased . He was anxious and extremely frustrated by the meeting and concerned that he'd thrown away his only shot . A Cup Series opportunity is the dream of every stock car racer from Lake Norman to Lake Tahoe . There may never be another opportunity . Jimmie bought a one-way ticket to North Carolina . He ran a few races but the relationship was short-lived . The team was outmanned .

Upon realizing it's Johnson they relent and move along .
