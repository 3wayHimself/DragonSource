 Fortress India has been sacked . Or should that be SOKed ? Not since 2012 had India lost a Test at home and rarely in that stretch of 20 matches had they even been held to a draw . Last time Australia toured India for Tests they were crushed 4-0 . They entered this match having lost their past nine Tests in Asia . Not since 2004 and the days of Gilchrist McGrath and Warne had Australia won a Test in India . Not even Nostradamus could have seen this result coming . took as many wickets as R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja combined . So many in fact that his 12 for 69 were the best figures ever by a visiting spinner in a Test on Indian soil . India were humbled for 105 and 107; never had they scored so few in a home Test loss . The match was over inside three days Australia the victors by 333 runs . The series is still alive of course but India have much to ponder over the next week ahead of the Bangalore Test . It would be easy to look at pitch and suggest the toss played a significant role but that would be unfair to Australia who outplayed India in all facets of the game and more than doubled their totals in both innings . In any case Australia had won all four tosses back in 2013 . No this a was a victory based on outstanding left-arm spin from O'Keefe whose accuracy and ability to turn some deliveries but not others made him a constant threat; on a remarkable 109 from Smith in the second innings which some observers said was the best hundred they had seen; on fielding that was not quite flawless but not far off it . And yes on what looked from the outside like a mental capitulation from India's batsmen in both innings . This was the 10th home Test of India's summer . It would be natural that they might show signs of fatigue but there are three more Tests in this series . They must find a way to perk up quickly . If they are searching for positives at least they have two extra days of recuperation ahead of the second Test . They can take little else from this result their first loss in a home Test since England prevailed in Kolkata in December 2012 . That too was a win that featured a defining hundred from the visiting captain on that occasion Alastair Cook . In Pune Smith's 109 - more than the entire India team scored in either of their innings - helped to ensure Australia's victory . It was his 18th Test hundred his fifth in consecutive Tests against India and his first on Indian soil . And given the pitch and the quality of India's bowlers surely his best . He made the most of his luck - dropped three times on the second day - and resumed on the third morning on 59 with Australia's lead already standing at 298 . Already enough the way India batted . But Smith made sure of it scored freely on both sides of the wicket using his feet to India's spinners and forging partnerships of consequence with several men in the middle and lower order . When he was finally lbw trying to pull Jadeja his job was done . Some late slogging from Mitchell Starc who hit three sixes in his 30 off 31 balls helped lift Australia to 285 and set India 441 for victory . They would have to break the all-time record for the highest successful chase in Test history in order to keep their unbeaten home streak alive . They never looked like getting close . Within six overs they had lost both their openers and both their reviews and all of their hope . O'Keefe broke through in his first over when he skidded one on to trap Vijay lbw and in the next over Nathan Lyon spun one in to strike KL Rahul in line and another lbw was given . Both openers asked for reviews but neither were successful . It mattered little for the procession of wickets that followed were all straightforward enough that no reviews would have saved India . The wicket of Virat Kohli embodied India's uncertainty against O'Keefe: he shouldered arms confident that the ball would turn away from him and failed to detect that this one was going on with the arm . Kohli lost his off stump . Ajinkya Rahane followed by driving a catch to cover off O'Keefe and Ashwin was lbw on review when he pressed forward to O'Keefe and the ball struck pad fractionally before bat . Wriddhiman Saha came and went also lbw to an O'Keefe skidder and straight after tea the last remaining top-six batsman Cheteshwar Pujara fell in more or less the same way . India kept playing for turn O'Keefe kept rapping them in front with straight balls . Of course that is oversimplifying things: he turned enough deliveries to varying degrees that the straight ones became the danger when the batsmen expected turn that didn't come . By this stage O'Keefe had 12 wickets for the match and a realistic chance of overtaking Ian Botham's 13 as the best bowling by any visiting player in India . Instead Lyon ran through the remaining three wickets: Jadeja was bowled trying to cut Ishant Sharma was caught at leg gully and Jayant Yadav gloved a catch to Matthew Wade to make the result official . A result that nobody saw coming three days earlier . Australia clearly is a much better team than India . If they win this series they will have won 5 test series in India and 13 in the subcontinent . Smith has now made 5 consecutive century against India which is a New record !

Congratulations australia for putting a great determinated performance but they should not get complacent with this victory and they should not forget all the humiliation they got from last SC tours and let me also tell u India took a risk by providing turning track in order to win series quickly and practice in green top for final but has back fired so what ? they may not be able to get practice in final test that's the only thing they may miss but not winning series better than aus last time Well played Oz a thoroughly deserved win . Bowlers looked to have got their length spot on which is the key to deception the batsmen seemed trapped and afraid to use their feet . Smith did and it should have cost him his wicket early but his bravery ultimately paid rewards . What are the pitches like at the next venues ? Shane Warne has been slagging of Steve O'Keefe completely in the run up to this test saying he is the weakest link in the Australian bowling attack and that Australia should look to replace him with a leg spinner like Adam Zampa or Mitchell Swepson . What Shane Warne knows about bowling in India can be written on the back of the smallest stamp available nine test matches an average of 43 . 11 and a strike rate of 81 . 0 Shane Warne should shut up about his thoughts on Steve O'Keefe . The bottom line is throughout his career Shane Warne was never as impactful in India as a leg spinner or spinner as Steve O'Keefe was in India . Shane Warne was completely wrong in his assessment about Steve O'Keefe and should simply swallow his pride as he was slagging of O'Keefe for several weeks before a ball was bowled . Steve O'Keefe will go onto being more successful in the series in terms of wicket taking than Shane Warne ever was in a series in India that is going to be hard to stomach for Shane Warne . One cannot ignore the contribution of the Aussie's spin bowling coach ex-Indian all-rounder Sriram had on this victory . O'Keefe pointed it out in a couple of his interviews he also had high praise for England's Panesar ! The emergence of O'keefe in this game is good news for Australia . It will create some friendly competition between Lyon and himself for the number one spinning position . Well done Australia ! You showed these pretenders how it should be done ! ! Pathetic display by Team India . Hard to believe that this isn't the same team that beat a powerful England Team recently by 4 - 0 . We sadly seem to be back to the bad old days of panic . . . surely an Indian team has never been so badly humiliated in India however common it has been abroad . They are the worst travellers of the major Test playing countries . Sad pathetic and disappointing . So the result of the Test series . . . hmm unless they buck their ideas up quickly it'll only be a humiliating 4 - 0 Test drubbing in India . . . hard to see a recovery from this loss although I'd loved to be proved wrong . Batting and fielding needs to improve dramatically in all quarters before the next Test if they are to have any chance of competing with these Aussies . . . Ashwin and Jadeja bowled well in this game but what went against them was starc's 60 in first innings and 150+ lead in second innings . 5 bowler theory will work only if you have a wicket-keeper batsman like Andy flower/gilchrist/Sangakkara or Kallis/Sobers . Saha is a tailender and Ashwin is too late in his career to be transformed into a regular batsman maybe at the age of 22-23 Ashwin could have been groomed as a batsman . Yes India are undone . But if were Kumble-Virat Kholi I would still have Australia surprised next match by doing this: Drop Jayant and Ishant Rahane . Bring Kuldeep and Chahal and Hardik . India will have two new n hard to pick spin variety . Hardik must be the workhorse bowler . India XI: 1 Vijay 2 Rahul 3 Pujara 4 Kholi 5 Saha 6 Ashwin 7 Hardik 8 Jadeja 9 Chahal 10 Kuldeep 11 Umesh @DOWNTOWN_CRICFANATIC My bro I hope you were connected to those posts related to just finished BD vs Eng BD vs NZ & BD vs Ind series . I saw a big number of Indian fans praised us & few of them neglected us . You know what all the fingers aren't of same size . So you can't hope positive comments always from the fans . Some are naturally haters but that doesn't mean us to be haters as a counter . Hate always earns hate . It's only love & respect that can give you the same in return . So as a cricket fan I will always love to love the haters instead of countering them . I can bet no haters will be available in a near future if fans like you me & others will spread love & respect only . People what say ? ? Anyone talking about Jayant Yadav's role in the eleven ? ? Is he a mis-fit ? ? Especially when India already has two bowling all-rounders in Ashwin and Jadeja . No question on his performance to be fair he performed to his potential . But his role . What is he doing at 9 as batting cushion and bowling gentle off-spinners ? ? ? At best he bowls those dollies which even lower order batsman can play liesurely . India needs mystery wicket taking bowler . Chahal or Kuldeep Yadav might have wrecked more damage in Pune . They need to consider Jayant's role seriously . What say ? India needs video watching homework of players . Murali and Ishant are not a good fit for test . BCCI needs extensive player search across India . Also in IPL players like Kohli and Dhoni should not captain teams as it reveals their game strategy and only works against them in international cricket . well played aus congrats ! India certainly werent good enough so hope they focus and improve and not bother too much about outside babblings they dont matter as most of it is the venom they had been forced to keep it down during the amazing India's run so let them spew it out ! Gl InDia always with u The problem with the spin friendly wicket is that the toss carries too much weight . Say india batted first even if starc & hazlewood for 2 or 3 quick wickets others would play with a calm head knowing the condition would be worse for australia . When australia bats first indian batsmen know they will bat in the last innings . So they have to score 100 extra runs the condition is worsening . So they want to play their shots early to get some runs and it becomes difficult on the turning wicket . Pressure of being behind kills good decision making . Once handscomb got a few great catches Keefe and Lyon were relaxed and indians were under tremendous pressure . The best bet is to have great batting . Australia should replace the Marshes and possibly Wade . Ideally they need Voges may be they can try with Khawja and Maxwell . 1000+ comments ? ! Cant understand why our team is hated so much . . 1 loss and there is showering of hate comments here . . When we were winning matches back to backwhere were these 'expert analysers' from our neighbouring countriesmainly . . Please look into improving your own game and team instead of spending so much time criticising India on their performance in a billateral test series match . . And if you are so genuinely interested in cricketplease do applaud the team when we win the next game . Peace . Over 1000 comments says it all really ! Did somebody say test cricket is dying and boring ? I think not . Test cricket is the real winner here . Congratulations Australia on such an emphatic victory . Don't think many were expecting this to happen . Here's to an interesting series to ensue . @RIZWANODAYAR what ? subcontinent teams have always got hammered whenever they toured foreign let me remind u India went to aus last time and completed by showing proper technique and let me remind u aus didnot give green tops there but what can Ind do for that and let me remind u Ind have won lords test in a green pitch and drawn a lot of games in sa NZ and australia and tell me after how many years a foreign team managed to win a game in sc and after how many games aus won a test match in sc any idea Credit to Australia . They earned their win well deserved . India just showed up hoping things will work on their own and taken for granted that Ashwin n Jadeja will win the match for them anyway . Indian batting was fully intoxicated with home success . India needs to look at the role of Jayant Yadav . No fault of his though he has played well in his chances . But the question is Jayant batting at 9 must be a full blooded bowler not an all-rounder . His bowling is no more than filler . I would either play Karun Nair giving batting cushion or Kuldeep Yadav adding much needed mystery element . Kudos to certain friends from across the world who have genuinely come out in support of good cricket . To see some Bangladeshisri lankanpakistani and Indian fans turning down insane opinion of their own countrymen certainly restores some parity . Well done to all such people who support the interests of the game of cricket commonly regardless of the nation . Cricket as a whole needs unity . If the Australians can adapt and learn from the bad loss in SL and become good enough to beat a good Indian team in 3 days in foreign conditions for them there is no reason why subcontinental teams cannot learn from decades of bad results in Australian conditions and get better results when touring Australia . As an Englishman it pains me to write this but congratulations and well played Australia . Poetic justice given that this was a poor Test match pitch prepared to aid India's supposedly superior spinners; hopefully that idea has now been consigned to the bin and the wickets for the reminder of the series will be similar to those seen in the England series: This is only one match and I doubt that India will perform this poorly again but this result has certainly set up the series nicely . @cricloverbd2016 - being Bangladeshi myself i cannot disagree with your comment however you are being one sided other subcontinent fans face a host of comment-abuse from Indian fans as well when their respective team has a bad day . Actually that's the best part . This sub-continental animosity makes following cricket all the more exciting . It gives a way for the fans to directly engage with opponent team followers online . Sometimes it gets ugly but mostly its healthy . But one thing is for sure with this sort of performance from India their own test status will come into question in no time . I'm Sri Lankan Fan . . when we got slap from SA tour / End your everyone coment Sri Lanka should go 2nd category but all tours was put side country . Aus / Eng / SA always use their home land & fast bowling pitches to wrap all Asian Team & pit is dump but I really happy any of Asian team beat them any conditions . Unfortunately our Asian people not ge together support each other's . I was dream to BAN beat NZ at NZ home ground but BAN fought better than SL & IN when we compost the statistics last tours . Big Respect to The Aussies on this win . They were given absolutely no chance going in to this series by Indian cricket legends and public but have shown when you really put your minds to something nothing is impossible . Well done Proteas Supporter . the bowling lineup for India needs some tweaking like dropping ishant jayant and only playing 4 regular bowlers 6 batsman and 1 wk batsman . the bigger problem is the batting . once upon a time India was great at playing spin and we're easily bounced out . now it's the opposite . we can play pace all day and can't judge spin well . look at pujara he's a walking wicket for a quality off spinner like Lyon . you possibly need Gautam Gambhir in the team to negotiate spin . bring in Parthiv chahal Well the same tactic that worked against SA and wasn't deemed necessary against NZ or ENG has backfired here . You can't blame the IND bowlers . If you told your team they needed to aggregate 546 runs across two innings at home to win a test match they would take it every day and twice on Sundays . The fielding was pretty average as well . I hope the remaining tests are played on surfaces more like what the kiwis and poms saw but I'm guessing the IND brains trust will see this as an aberration and the next deck will turn backwards from ball one . I'm happy for SOK . I have a soft spot for left arm orthodox types and the SL kid that freaked in the first test against Oz more or less admitted that him leaving the match injured helped flip it and maybe the series . Who knows if this will be his 'Ray Bright' moment and like some other Aussie finger spinners he will just disappear but if Oz win this series he shouldn't have to ever pay for a drink again perhaps not a good idea for him though . This is probably Smithy's best test century yet as proof of the difficult batting surface . He is quietly averaging about 60 in test cricket not an attractive batsman by any means methodical in his approach and gets the job done ! Something has to be said about the steely character of the man ! When India wins I very hardly see praising comments from the fans of other countries specially the fans from the subcontinent . But when India fails a lot of negative comments start raining ! Why so ? First of all I'm a Bangladeshi fan . And then I'm a fan of cricket . If you are a fan of cricket how can you forget that cricket is the 2nd religion to a country India of more than 1000 million people ? Where do you see a jam pack stadium except India in a test match ? This country has produced legendary cricketers like Gavaskar Sachin S Ganguly R Dravid Laxman Kumble Dhoni Kohli & many others who are genuine proven world beaters . Some countries specially Zim W Indies Srilanka Pakistan are playing a far way below than they were playing few years back it's because of the retirement of some of their star cricketers . But India is totally different here . Just 3 bad days that's all . Please don't be haters . Best wishes for the Indian team . Congrats to Aus . The Australian batter were clueless in Srilanka and bowlers were having no idea how to bowel in spin tracks and got hammered yet they went back to drawing board batters manage to learn handle spin in turning track bowlers learned to use same tactics which tormented there batters against there opponent and came up with really strong show . In contrast sub continent team goes on tour and get hammered in greenish track and they go back again get hammered no any planning or learning in between tours thus this Australian team deserve admiration for there professionalism . this is what happens when u provide rank turner in order to win series quickly and try to provide green top in the last game for overseas preparation . It has horribly back fired and now the only thing left is to win the series in a better fashion than what Aus did last time at home and that is only possible by providing indian wickets and forget about green tops @SUN05: I don't think anybody in his right mind would mock the players you mentioned though Vijay and Rahane had a poor match . Ashwin is a class act and he bagged 7 wickets here and could have got 10 or more with better catching from the close in fielders . He is also India's opening bowler now with the new ball and it appears team management decided to have him open the bowling even before the match started . The problem India has is their almost non existent middle and lower order batting . Their second new ball bowler Sharma had very little to do in this match and even the third spinner did not do much . A couple of specialist batsmen would have helped instead . Remember this was really an innings defeat for India who scored less than 260 runs in both their innings combined . After defeat of BD in NZ some Indian fans comments like this [[Q-1]] [[Q-2]] etc . Dear aggressive Indian fans I comment at that time that bad time may come to anyone's case so pls . do not show disgrace to others . Now bad day has come to yours case but we are not laughing . I believe the remaining three games wd end very early than this game probably the remaining three tests wd end in two days with 350 to 400 run and Ings defeats to ind for all three games and indian whitewash by Australia . I also believe ind wd not even make 100 runs in both the Ings of Bangalore test Looking closely at India I think the batting line up is fickle with the tail starting at 5 . Losing 7 wickets for 11 runs in the first innings and marginally improving to 30 runs for the last 7 wickets in the second innings . Numbers 6-11 contributed only 12 runs in the first innings and 21 in the second . Rahane looks out of sorts hardly the player who scored that brilliant hundred at the MCG just a couple of years ago . The selection is baffling to say the least . If they had decided to open the bowling with Ashwin in both innings there was no need for Sharma in the team at all . Even J . Yadav didn't bowl much and was not very threatening when he did . They could have played a couple of specialist batsmen instead . Wonder what Nair must be thinking watching all this . @Rajesh_India_1990 [[Q-3]] Kohli = 13 runs in 2 innings Team India = 212 runs in the match Lowest test score by India in a home defeat : Steve Smith scores more in 1 innings than Team India can manage in either innings; therefore 11 Indians are lesser than 1 Steve Smith ! FACT ! ! ! This pitch in no way was an unplayable one as Smith rightly showed in his gritty second innings it was about hanging on and playing smart unfortunately Indian batsmen chose glory over sensibility and ended with many worsts . India may bounce back beat Aus in Blore but they need to bring in some sense into their batting . As Warne and Gavaskar rightly said sometimes the art of spinning is not to spin the ball Okeefe did that well Jadeja gave more revs to ball and it kept beating the batsmen who were happy to leave them . None of the Indian batsmen looked like they were keen on digging deep and playing a long innings many shots played by Indian batsmen raised questions if they know what the situation is . Jinx stands at crease and lofts ball straight into hands Kohli simply flashes at a ball outside off stump . Basically it was all about application and playing long innings which none of the Indian batsmen seemed interested in What an awful pitch ! The ICC should sanction such boards and curators . What an awful sight seeing it turn square on day 1 . Well done Australia it was made to happen to you but you fought hard and ensured it came back to haunt the hosts on a rank turner ! India has lost only one match and we all are after Indian team . This time around law of averages has prevailed nothing else . Things would drastically change from second test on-wards . But one thing I could sense that is over reliance on Virat . But one thing needs to be believed that this loss would mature India than numerous wins . When the going gets tough the tough gets going . . . : This win has set up the series nicely ! Based on recent history the Indian batsmen have proven that they are just as vulnerable on rank turners . I suspect India will come back hard in the second test but from a psychological standpoint Australia has to be brimming with confidence ! There is a lot of cricket yet to be played so it is still anybody's series to win ! This loss is by far the most humiliating disgraceful shameless atrocious painful defeat to team india ever as far i remember . The most embarrassing part was our batting no batsman apply themselves only pujara 1st inning wicket was only wicket which australia earn other was gifted by india that show these batsman can't play even in the spinning track let alone fast bouncy green top . This massacre by australia is equivalent to 2 4- 0 whitewash . I think ashwinvijay are very tired they should take rest & prepare for ipl . Rahul vai focus on short format only Rahane not good enough player to play spin . jayant was very poor . Only jadeja umesh kohli were giving their 100% other were sheepy . I think we need kuldeep shreyes karunbhuvimukund deserve chance . Already loss our status by this demeaning defeat . Rahul Vijay Rahane jayant & ashwin deserve axe for this unbeleivable loss . Overconfidence has left them down massivly & rightly got gobsmacked . A . Mukund dropped the Test match for India not once but twice . . . for those who are clamoring for his inclusion in the Test side ! Kohli has a major headache with Rahane he has been getting opportunities based on his past performances but his current form is woeful ! An odd century will not resurrect it . Twelve wickets were stolen by O'Thief and margin was 333 reminding all of us that there are three tests still left . SOK has created enough doubt in the minds of Indian batsmen by bowling well disguised straighter ones which will play its role if India opt for flatter ones now on-wards . If he can get India's best batsmen Kohli with a straighter one then rest of them are certainly more vulnerable . Furthermore if tracks are flatter then the effectiveness of Ash/Jaddu will go down further . I am sure Aussies will remained unchanged for the 2nd test and hope that Renshaw will not have upset stomach this time . On the other hand India have to get rid of Vjay Rahane Ishant Saha at least and for that they can take a leaf from the book of Aussies who themselves had to do wholesale changes after that spectacular collapse against SA and now look a different power . India also need to have a left arm leg spinner in place of Ishant . Whatever the pitch condition IND should not get out 100 odd runs twice it becomes more interesting considering it is at home . But IND also have lot of quality in their batting and moderate in bowling . Indian spinners will surely be threat in this series . Aussies shouldn't also be over confident . I think their batting and bowling is above average . Reality is they prepared well and executed well in the match . But this won't be in the entire series . And lastly the Kohli factor you just cannot keep him quiet longer . An exciting series is approaching . From a BD fan . India way over hyped as team . After this shambles and i guess the first real test they have failed misrably . I gues they achieved one thing and that is you cant know call them backyard bullies any more . This serious will be intresting on many fronts . Aussies well done . Overconfidence hubris or just sheer good luck for the aussies having first bat and scoreboard pressure on this bunsen Australia have won . India have hopefully realised their batting is woeful and save Kohli/the 3 spinner 'allrounders' most of the england games would have gone the other way . Most important we have a series on . So rather than try and one up each other with comments lets rejoice that there is an element of unpredicatabilty in this subcontinent tour now ! ! India would always win on the wear them down tracks against the likes of england but Aus have the x factor of warner at the top which gives them a great chance of going 2 up should a pitch like that be presented and another bat first situation . With Starc in the ranks aswell this makes adds an extra intrigue and imo evens things up of not gives Aus the edge no matter what . I am under no illsuion that this India side is not great but i do feel Kohli is and that alone might prove to be good enough . Time to proove it ! ! Wow ! One bad test match and we find record no of comments frm both Indian and other country fans cursing and mocking Indian players especially Vijay Rahane and Ashwin . Why their predecessors were better than them or other countries have superior players ? No right . So shut up and appreciate Aus who played better cricket in this test . O runs 0 wickets contribution of our so called great fast bowler ishant in dis match i don't know when our selectors wil get rid of ishant from indian cricket . There r much better fast bowlers like sirajthakurnathuthampiavesh khan etc than ishant in domestic circuit . Instead of selecting ishant in dis match on dis type of pitch we could hav easily played an extra batsman karun nair & who knows result could hav been different . One bad performance and all these trolls are in a full flow but they forget that India we have a 17 match unbeaten record which was unfortunately broken by Aussies but I am sure that we will work out d method of o Keefe and will win d series 3-1 Aussies should stop gloating out here cause this is just 1 victory so hold it horses When I switched on the TV on first day morningI got irritated to see Ishant Sharma was running to bowl and I felt that India would be in trouble . I do not know what special talent he has . He can not bowl can not bat and can not field . But every captain thinks that he could do something and almost every time he does nothing . How can we win a match by facing the mighty aussies with only 10 players ? Karun Nair deserves a chance next . . . rest Rahane jayant yadav . . I always feel jadeja is over hyped all rounder ? ? ? ! ! ! . . May be amit mishra or yuzvendra chahal can bring some change . . . high time Ishant sharma should retire from all forms of cricket . . . he does not fit in the squad any more . . . even IPL teams are not interested in him . . . Rahul along with Rohit sharma looks best opening pair with karun nair in the middle . . Saha needs to step up soon . . . looking at history of Indian cricket I feel O'Keefe will feel the might of Indian batsmen in next matches . . . remember what happened to Shoib akhtar and ajanta mendis after the debuts against India . . . they were treated mercilessly by Sachin and co . . . . best of luck next time Few things I couldn't forget in my life . 2 years back was in India for conference was seeing an ad in star [[Q-4]] during WC . What's that hype ? Really funny Australia took it it without any toil ha ha . Now few comms pre series [[Q-5]] 4-0[[Q-6]] innings defeat[[Q-7]] ind will smash you innings defeat[[Q-8]] wait and wait . . . . . . Waited guys I know who's better team . Stop gloating and be humble enough . Steve O'Keefe spun the ball just enough to trouble batsmen . His overall figures in this match are beyond compare . He was very well supported by Gary Nathan Lyon . Nice cameo by Mitch Starc shifted the momentum in Australian favour . Indian bowlers should also try to contribute by bat in remaining matches . Ravindra Jadeja was also spinning the ball but the amount of spin imparted to ball was far more . Why no-one asked Ravindra Jadeja to pitch the ball on middle-leg so that extra spin could trouble the batsman ? Why no-one asked Ravindra Jadeja to bowl over the wicket to right handers for few overs ? I hope Indian skipper gleaned few things from this match . Next test match is very crucial we expect Indian batsman to come out of shell and play some strokes . If anyone wants to know what Boomerang means he should watch this game . This game will do more damage to the cocky Indian XI than most people imagine . Just like how visiting batters always second-guessed every other move they made this will too . Only it will be on the minds of Indian batsmen . AUS is not losing this series . Indian skipper said after match [[Q-9]] This is probably the right statement to give on team combination because if the team had drawn or won the match then everyone would be singing hymn for Indian players . The most dis-appointing feature of Indian batting in this match was no intent to attack the bowlers . Ravindra Jadeja Lokesh Rahul showed some intent to play aggressive shots in first innings remaining batsmen just waited for dismissal in both innings . Aussie skipper cashed on chances provided by Indian fielders . If you look closely the technique of Steve Smith in this match his left foot was never stationary . He was in search of runs left foot moved forward or sometimes backward allowing him to negotiate spin better . Steve Smith adapted to situation very well . Also credit should be given to Australian cricket administration for pre-tour activities like playing in Dubai involving Madhusudan Panesar Sridharan Sriram . One poor performance after a long long time and so much of criticism . Bet Kohli and company will do much better in the next matches . Congratulations to Australia for a superb performance though . From a subcontinent teams perspective Pakistan were thrashed in NZ and Australia without any fight except one innings by Pakistan . SL were absolutely thrashed in both tests and ODI's in SA without an iota of fight and have been losing everywhere generally . Bangladesh ofcourse are learning their trade . India has bee sublime at home and were pretty good in all away tours before the home season begin NZ SAEng Aus albeit without winning much . Their should be no doubt that they are the best team across formats from sub continent and only BD has been consistent in ODI's . So let's stop this tirade against Indian cricket team owing to one failure and wait for the series to get over . First of all credit were its due . . Well played Aussies . . . To outplay India on a rank turner is some effort . . . Some may call it fluke and all but to dismiss India for 100 or something both innings and winning by 333 runs on such a pitch is a huge win in any era that too coming against an all conquering Indian side in home condition . . This can certainly be compared with India's win at Kolkata 2001 against an all conquering Aussie side . . . But having said that i am not sure if Aussies could maintain the same pressure on India for rest of the tour . . But any day this is a golden feather for Australian cricket considering their young and inexperienced side who was considered by all to go down 4-0 . I think it will still be a moral victory for Aussies to lose 3-1 from here considering their horrible record in Asian conditions . . . Kudos for Smith and his boys . . Expecting Indian to give them reality check in coming days but now is the time we give credit where it is due being a cricket lover . @ cricfan24930413 I can understand it hurts . Things are judged by what really happened not by some one's wishful thinking . Australia had so much reparation prior to the SL series even getting Murali into their net which angered the SL admin . So you can't say they were unprepared . Be in Sri Lanka or in Australia we have won two back to back series & that what the record says & it is a good record to hold until the next series . @ Herath-UK - accepted IND team and fans are a bit down today and it has been a heavy defeat . However by no means that makes SL the team to beat overnight ! Besides T20 and that one home series against AUS I dont think you guys have won much else recently . BD tour is a tricky one for your team followed later by IND who beat you guys last time they toured there for tests if I remember right . So one step ate a time my friend ! Also remember this series has 3 matches still to go ! @DECCAN_EXPRESS im sri lankan . Kohli has butchered us many times over . So im not biased in HIS favour at all but to say that kohli always fails in important matches is simply prepostorous . He's a legend . Are you saying that the england tests werent important ? One can understand there are a lot of IND baiters who must be overjoyed today but my friends hold your horses and keep your comments somewhere in the realms of reality though I doubt that will happen looking at the quality of posts seen here . Agreed it was a heavy and unexpected defeat for IND but to question their test credentials based on one match is plain ridiculous ! I am sure your own teams have felt their punch in the past and will continue to do so . Dont worry about that ! [[Q-10]] . May have been true when there was the embarrassment of riches in domestic cricket in the 60s and 70s . Besides Bedi Prasanna Chandra Venkat we had Shivalkar Goel VV Kumar Mumtaz Hussain Parsanna . I'm sure I didn't get all the names in . And no IPL and ODIs . Now they are really bad at dealing with spin . England exposed it with Monty and Swann . Tentative waiting for the ball to do its magic . Not getting to the pitch . Lyon and O'Keefe looked more likely to get a ball every wicket than Ashwin and Jadeja . Prepare a turner and India dies faster than the opposition . @ Nagesh : No you are wrong . Despite flat roads in Aus you guys lost 0-2 . What if the pitches were fast & bouncy ? Traditional Aus pitch . 0-4 right ? Aus has declared 6 times in that series . Your flat bully Kohli would have been scoring 101503021 had been bouncy track . Smith is miles miles ahead of Kohli . Give credit or move on and get ready for IPL circus . Well what do you expect from Indian think tank ? They thought to sink Aus with the rank turner but the world now know what is the outcome . Should India opted to play with the similar turner pitch against Bangladesh the result would have been different as well who knows ? More nerve wrecking moments are on the way that for sure . Lot of our neighbors particularly SL and BD fans are so happy with this result as they could not do the same . . . BD fans like EMON_DAS India won 16 matches on the trot among an undefeated streak of 19 since the last win . When you win that many in your entire test match history you can talk about India's test status . BD is a decent limited overs side and an improving test side but fans like you seem to think you are some all-time Test XI and invite trolling from others . SL friends - SL is good at home but India have been better in the last few years . Let us acknowledge that . 1 loss out of 20 matches in 2 years ! Back to the match - I don't understand this pitch . Spoiled India's home win reputation further as being spin track bullies when most pitches this home season were very reasonable and not like this sand pitch . We should play on regular decks that offer turn day 3 onwards that's when we are at our best . Pressure mounting on IND selection committee . I won't be surprised if they announce something like [[Q-11]] . Obviously they try to save these failure players career until another series with a weaker team . This is the worst selection committee in decades which is ignoring huge domestic talent . Look at the second innings how Vijay faced 23 balls . He gave dozen chances and finally got out . He simply does not know how to play spin . As I said earlier Virat always fail in important matches . Well played Australia . . . . . But don't get on the 9th clouds soon . . . . . . Few month back same team lost by innings and 80 runs in ur own den against SA . . . . . . . getting all-out for 80 & 160 odd . . . . . . India is very good side to bounce back & I am sure India taking series . . . . . Good luck both side for great series . . . . . Any surprise there ? I'm not guys . These home heroes can play only if the pitches are flat like roads . Any swing/seam/pace/bounce/spin that's it they will surrender . So hopefully these bullies would prepare flat road in next test . If so Aus will literally thrash ind bowlers . I back Aus from Japan ha ha . 4-0 has become now 3-1 later next week 2-2 then ? 1-3 ? ? Ha ha . Keep calm and respect the oppositions folks . I'll be happy if Australia wins this series . Oh boy Smith you are next Bradman buddy . You will rule the world :;- Herath-UK - NO you are wrong . . in almost all interviews reg Indian tour Smith has said how much their team learnt from the SL series about how to play in sub continent how to tackle spin etc . SOK had sessions with Herath Vettori Sriram about bowling on dry pitches . . All of this paid off . This victory is actually a result of their learning from SL tour . pretty sure if Aus had toured SL again now they would win it hands down . SL are by no means the team to beat . You can say that SL tour was a good preparation for Aus for their tour to India . @WORSTSIDE Never said that the Australian team that lost to SA in Hobart is the same that thrashed India inside 3 days in Pune . Australia removed the deadwood & won the dead rubber D/N Adelaide Test against SA to save face and make the series scoreline a more respectable 1-2 . My point was India too can make a comeback and don't be surprised if they actually pay Australia back with vengeance in the remaining 3 Tests . Howeverdo not see India remove the deadwoodRahane & Ishant while selecting the XI for Bangalore . India beat SA in Kolkata in 2009-10 thanks to Harbhajan's brilliance after losing by an innings in in Nagpur . Have been quite effusive in praise as a neutral fan about Australia's unbeaten record in a Test series in SA since the readmission of the Proteas to international cricket in 1991 . Have used this unbeaten record of the Aussies in SA to convey reality checks to tomtomming SA fanswho keep clamoring of how great their team has been basis their stellar away Test series record . Some of the comments seeking removal of Rahane and Murali Vijay shows the short-memory which some fans possess . Didn't Rahane win a test at Lords' On one of the greenest wickets and has a scored runs everywhere ? Hasn't Vijay been an exceptional opener across the world for this side always seeing off the new ball and scoring big hundreds in England Australia and Sri Lanka ? In fact he scored a hundred in the last test two in England series . Karun Nair did very well in his 3rd test but with all due respect that means nothing in comparison to going abroad and doing well in trying conditions esp . when more reputed players were floundering around them . Let's hold our horses this is the side which has done well over the last two years and let's back them to deliver . From India's perspective- Ashwin and Jadeja look jaded with 10 tests of bowling . A break against Bangladesh would have done them a world of good . A rank turner in Bangalore could help if and only if India bat first and put up a 350+ score . Psyche of Indians has been hurt more with this defeat than morale of Australia being up and can the hosts regroup to win the series ? Father time has the answer and as of nowonly father time has the answer . over scrutiny really . I mean this Indian team hasn't lost anything . Last time they lost at Halle due to bad umpiring they followed with 16 wins . Any team who wins that many bound to loose one here and there . Australia has only 1 decent batsmen in this Aussie team Well done Aussies ! You showed the Indians how to bat bowl & field in this match ! Reality strikes down hard and its hit India where it hurts the most - in the home ground . India didnt just lose they got buried thanks to their over-confidence . A cruel awakening and deservedly so . The brain freeze of the Indian batsmen in the first innings cannot be excused no matter the defense they build around it . How crucial was Starc's cameo in the end ? ! 2 wrong reviews taken within 6 overs of the 2nd innings ! That's how desperate India were . Yes Eng got plummeted but they didnt have the bowlers to come strong against the Indian batting & with all due respects to Bangladesh's growth in cricket they are still teens amongst the grown-ups of the cricketing fraternity . Having these two series as the yardstick wasnt going to do justice to Ind cricket and the very first match post these series Ind gets beaten black & blue ! Well played O'Keefe Smith & the Oz team Deserving winners ! Oh what a performance by the mighty Australia . Our team should learn from Aus how to play spin . This is absolute rubbish and ridiculous from India . Rank turners backfired us . No excuses or whatsoever we are to be blamed . I can see few passengers in our team Rahane Ishant Saha what is their role ? Good for nothing . Paid 10 lakhs per test lol . Well played Aus I hate to say now it looks you can win this series 2-1 or 3-0 . Harbhajan and Ganguly should zip their mouths . It's really disgusting guys . One thing cricket is unpredictable game . Losing one test doesn't means India is bad team . India and Australia both teams have good players . Team performance is evaluated based on statistics- no of matches played in a year and no of win out of them . So instead of abusing team India we should rather say common India and well played team Australia . The problem is that it was not the bowling at fault in this match but the much vaunted batting . It is certain not one of the batters will lose their spot after this defeat and probably they will sacrifice a bowler and cushion the batting with a sixth batsman . I think India lost this match with atrocious batting in their first innings and equally abominable catching in the Aussie second innings . None of the batsmen were out on totally unplayable deliveries in the first innings . Kohli was bound to fail as the law of averages says . And one can ignore his failure in this match considering the rich vein of form he is in . But one cannot ignore the consistent inconsistency from the likes of Vijay Rahul and Rahane . I was particularly disappointed with the gory shot that Rahul played after all the hard work in the first innings . That to me was the turning point of the match . After that everyone else fell like nine pins . This collapse once again reiterates my belief that the chinks in Indian batting armor were camouflaged in the past series due to the stupendous form of Kohli and Pujara . India has been playing with only 5 batsmen all through but they were not tested . It is good that they will now have to think about their strategy going forward . After Cook and Khan I think the mantle of best Test batsman goes to Smith . He played a great innings on an impossible pitch . However this is only 1 match and the series is still wide open hopefully India will bounce back strong after this the problem is they dont have their greatest strength anymore which is spin . Congratulation to Smith & brave Aussies on a over whelming win over India . It was a gutless & pathetic batting by an over confident India in both the innings . This was on the same pitch where the Australian bats had 3x 50's in the first innings & a century in the second . Ashwin & jadeja rated as the Top 2 bowlers in the world but were humiliated when they forgot the art of Wkt . taking which was aptly demonstrated by O'Keefe ! Aussies showed India how to take great catches . Smith showed Kohli & rest of the Indian batsmen how to build an innings & score century on such a track . In short the Aussie outplayed India in every department of the game . Indian batting + catching looked like that of [[Q-12]] ! Kumble & Kohli have to stop giving excuses . Both teams played on the same track where India got out twice for just over 100 while Aussies scored over 250 runs in each innings ! This one sided whipping of India on their home turf never happened before ! Wake up Kohli & Team India ! HA HA HA . Got buried in the grave they have dig for others . Rank turners from first bowl on day 1 foot marks from day 1 . And Indian fans were proud of his team . They were like [[Q-13]]mon cricketing world knows dust bowls are prepared to show how dominant the home side is but to prepare a pitch that turned square from over number three was definitely for the mouse that eventually played into the hands and got the better of cat . I listened to this match on the radio truly old school and it lacked nothing despite the lack of visual confirmation ! The fact that we have to pay to see these matches is something where our group indignation should truly be visited upon those that dictate our the fans game & is something that needs to be looked into . I respect that statistically we can all put forth arguments that are valid . What I cannot stand is the vitriol directed at each other and the braggidaccio on behalf of our teams that leads to the insults and degenerative nature directed at each other . We all love this game; that is plainly obvious ! Acknowledge and give respect where due and move forward for the benefit of the game and all followers . It is just a game; admittedly a great game and inclusively all its gladiators therein; but let us not lose focus ! For should we continue down this path we will do a greater dis-services I it than those that seek to manipulate us from behind the scenes . A very good Aussie team beat India . So what haven't home teams lost ! McGrath always predicts 5-0 Ashes and has fallen on his face . India were totally outclassed by a fantastic team . As a cricket fan accept this defeat and it can happen to any team . Yes many fans were over the moon predicting 4-0 and have been proved wrong ! Aus will have an upper hand in bagalore as tge pitch bounce which suits both their pace and spin so another cracking Test on the cards Team and selectors should stop the ego . And select the team on opponent and condition base . Always team should be mix of young and experienced players to guide and handle the situation when required . Ghambir is a good player of spin . Consider him in next matches . Youngsters will learn from him also will help the team when sudden collapse like this happens . It must be said that before the series started that Australia were better prepared and motivated to do well . O'Keefe didn't play in the BBL to prepare for this series and the team went to Dubai where they trained on similar wickets . Lyon spoke of how he analyzed Ashwin's bowling before the match by watching videos . They took help from Vettori and Panesar before the series began and their spin coach Sriram knows Indian conditions very well . So the Australian team must be given credit for their hard work and preparation . I hope we do something similar when we tour . Before that we must greatly improve our play against spin and fielding if we are to stand a chance in this series . I'm afraid Australia have their best chance in a long time to win this series by a good margin . I believe ind has no chance of coming back into this series ind took aus very lightly and have paid the price of it and when you give a side like aus a chance in tests they wd not spare you indian whitewash on the cards 4-0 with all other three tests also finishing inside 3 days with o Keefe being the man of the series mark my words . At that time disappointment on the pitch was the only annoyance . By now there are far more pointy ends poking me from behind . I am tempted to use the same phrase on multiple counts now staring from the very top - Captain Kohli . Without listing them I would just use the same phrase: @FOREXCELIENCEINCRICKET [[Q-14]] I was expecting to see the necessary [[Q-15]] qualification to that statement but you must have forgotten it . Yes India has been dominant IN INDIA just like Australia has been dominant in Australia SA dominant in SA etc etc . Since most teams win at home . . . India don't have much to gloat about in that regard . Have India been dominant outside the SC ? LOL . Congrats to AUS for a thumping and comprehensive win . One cannot recall the last time IND was decimated in this fashion not even overseas let alone at home ! However I would reserve any further comments for now . One match does not make them a bad team overnight nor take away their recent unbeaten run . What was a bit worrying was their batsmen appeared to be mentally overwhelmed and bowlers outperformed . Plenty for them to think about before the second test ! @HDG1978 To Australia's credit they removed most of the deadwood after that loss to SA and have won 5 tests in a row so I'd hardly say it's the same side . . not even close . And so what if SA have won 3 series in a row in Australia I think you'll find the Aussies have won in SA even more . None including you & me would have expected India to be thrashed in this manner . So this victory has come like an ice-cream cone with an extra scoop of hot-chocolate on top of it . You have every right to gobble up a few and thrust one on my face all in fun & joy . The only response from me will be shaking your hands even more with all the choco on my face Now on brass tacks . I think you have the bowling probably to win the series . The probability is NOT closer to zero as I said a few days ago . It has risen much higher . As I said then the 'probability' always get revised with more evidence emerging one way or the other . Which way it has; is crystal clear . Congrats Australia ! They were so good that even if Smith was out on a duck . . twice even . . . even then they would have won ! So good . Just cannot say its cos india was that bad . I then thot . . no this pitch wasnt prepared for india's benefit . But then . . isnt it a rank turner ! ? Wonder what to say then . No excuse . Brilliant australia thats all . As an indian fan i dont care even if australia lose the series from here . . . cos i just wonder when would India win a test in Australia like this even if we lose the series from there ! How i wish . Anyways how aussies have turned the tables since that S . A . series loss ! Like Ponting once said its our turn to say that aussies made us curl our tail inwards ahem . Lets just congratulate them and walk away like gents ! haha . Good game . Cheers . Meanwhile some fickle fans would suddenly say india has no talent n virat is no good n bla bla . Short memory indeed ! but that was the case forever ! This . . was . . nywys . . . a bodyblow ! stunned ! knocked us out cold . lol Okay folks gotta re-iterate that apart from Harbajahn truly a great bowler of the spinning family yet allows personal grudges to pass from his brain to his mouth unfiltered ! we need to acknowledge that our national cricketing representatives have done their best and that this was the outcome . This game in particular however happened to go against the Indian team . Just accept it as i have done as an Australian supporter for many years in regard to our sub-continental escapades . If we were all worthy of representing our nation would things have been different ? Doubt it ! And the same train of thought applies to our opinions of what we all think should've been enacted by our respective players . They've done the best they can there endeth the argument . I have had enough of seeing the vitriol being offered by all and sundry regarding their team . Valid it may be mostly not . Let us all commend those whom deserve it for their efforts and anticipate what is to come minus boast I won't count Ind out especially at home . Expect fight back if the #1 ranking means anything . But rotating spinners won't be a bad idea . These days the spinners seem to have a shorter life span unless you are a Herath thanks partly to all the data and video footage available to batsmen . India were complacent after long winning run in home matches . But they must remember that was against weaker teams . No doubt it's Australia's weakest team to visit India in last 30 years still they prepared well . They went to Dubai to practice on slow pitches . On the other hand India was feeling over confident that they will steamroll Australia very easily . That was never bound to happen with this complacency . This loss due to over confidence and under estimating opponents . We already lost when they played with 5 batsman . . . They got success with 5 batsman strategy against England and Bangladesh . They should have played with Karun Nair in team . Hope they will not make this mistake in Bangalore . . @Cooljack How exactly did Ashwin bowl badly against Bangladesh ? He picked up 6 wickets in the match I believe . He's not going to turn up every match and run through the side . Even in this match I believe he bowled reasonably well . When you have 5 catches dropped off of your bowling then nothing can be done . It is the failure of the batsman and the poor fielding that cost us this match not the bowlers . Australia played for no turn so the ball spun bast the bat . We played for turn and were getting out to the straighter delivery . I see a lot of people asking for Ashwin to be dropped . Lets be fair and say that Ashwin and Jadeja bowled reasonably well . Ashwin had around 4-5 catches dropped off of his bowling . You need brilliance in the field like what Handscomb did . To bowl out the Aussies for around 250 in each innings is a reasonable job by the bowlers . When your batsman fail to cross 150 in both innings then there is no use pointing fingers at the bowlers . I suggest we bring in a few youngsters in to the batting lineup like Nair Pant or Iyer . If Australia win the next test it could be 4-0 for them . I remember South Africa beat us by an innings in 2010 and we came back in the next match to level the series . More recently we must look to Galle in Sri Lanka . We were thoroughly outdone by Herath on a spinning wicket and came back brilliantly to win the series . We must show similar mental fortitude and resilience if we are to win this series . @MILEPOST Agree on the fine part as this Indian team needs to be censured for a spineless performance . @CRIKETLOVER This same Australian team was shot out for 85 by SA in Hobart to lose the Test inside 3 days1 day rained off also to concede their 3rd consecutive home Test series to SA since 2008-09 . This Aussie team is definitely beatable with probably 4 world class players in their XI in WarnerSmithStarc & Hazlewood . Krejza bagged a lot of wickets in 1 Test in India in 2008-09 . So would not read much into O'Keefe's 12 wicket haul performance . Still expecting India to win this Test series 2-1 . Only surprise has been Australia winning the 1st Test of this series and the massive margin of victory attributed to India's unexpected 7/11 meltdown that psychologically took the sails out of Team India's wings . A timely lesson for the supremely confidentor over-confident Kohli . why is ishant Sharma still playing cricket . drop Saha bring in Parthiv and let him open with Rahul . bring Karin nair and let the team have 7 batsman including wicketkeeper and 4 specialist bowlers . jayant Yadav is not an international quality spinner . he may have batted well against a mediocre bowling lineup like Englland but is not cut out to play teams like Australia . instead bring Mishra or chahal in if u need 3 spinners along with yadav . no point having too many bowlers when u have unlimited overs and useless bowlers India is a No . 1 based on record and rules set up by ICC . It is not that hard to understand . Aussies have played brilliantly and deserve kudos . Mixing the two issues doesn't change plain facts . If No . 1 tennis player gets beaten by a lower ranked improving player doesn't mean No . 1 rank were flawed . Hope this . makes it simple to understand . I'm sure team management didn't ask for that pitch . No one wants rank turner from day one esp not this team which wants Sporting wickets so they can prepare for away tour . This is the problem when you play such important tour on Rookie pitches which even hosts don't know much about . Frankly speaking Ash is past his prime form . His bowling is all one dimensional . He needs to take a break . Jaddu way far from him . Ash is breaking records but simply not contributing anything for the teams cause . Teams get so used to him these days that he's become a soft target for all the teams . I'm sure even if Afghans visit india they will take on Ashwin . That's the current scenario . give him break let him go & come back fresh . He thinks too much . I'd say more than batters Spin bowling & idiotic fielding cost ind the match . Why don't you get good sub fielders . Abinav mukund you need to go back wher u came from . u r rediculous in the field . Pandya better . Jayant looked clueless . hes day dreaming . It is going to be tough for India to comeback this series Aussies dont give an inch particularly in this position . Too many weakness glossed over by exceptional performance of few . PREPARATION -seems to be the key for aus . It was Aussie batting that was the difference more than bowling . They were well prepared for even a rank turner clues were thrown regarding one edge if only our batsmen cared they could have fared better . Simply current crop was not challenged enough by quality spin - not many great options in domestic setup who would have performed better . All our batsman who were getting runs suddenly & collectively donot fail - it was just great planning & execution by aussies . Now I want my team to only make better use of 2 extra days and prepare as well as they can and HOPE for the best . Brilliant Australia take a bow ! Smith's innings is one for the ages because he scored more than the entire Indian team on a surface that should be as alien as it can get for Aussies . It just shows clarity in Smith's headspace and grit to stick to the task . I still say Aussie batting wasn't that impressive . It will be a problem in next few test matches . Smith has to score all the runs for Australia and Kohls for India . Ashwin was outbowled in this match but he too is a class act . I still back India to win this series 3-1 same happened in Sri Lanka too . Ashwin needs a break from intern'l cricket for sometime . He's overthinking & messing up things . Soon he will loose his no1 ranking . Everyone is taking him apart including Bangla . No point playing the same player who is impactless recently . Huge respect for what's he's done in past but now he needs break . Bring in fresh minds like Nair kuldeep Chahal JadavIyer . Waywith which this team lost vs spin reminds me of eng tour when Monty Swann ripped Indians apart . Expecting similar result with Ausie win but atleast let's show some respect to the bench strength . plz get rid of Ashwin for a couple of tests quite bored & frustrating to see bowler of his caliber bowl howlers . All the good things done till now are going into drain with just one series . Ausies have come up with firm determination to silent their critics . not the way they batted but also the way they fielded was superb . Indian spin bowling & fielding to me is Worser than batting which depended on toss anyways . Congratzz Australia . U make the history again . u put India put under huge preasure early in this series . Sri lanka had faced against almost the same Australia team in last year . Thrashed them easily . I think This match lost by india because of the Wrong selection of players . I have saw Some useless players are playing in the 11 . Upcomming India tour of Sri lanka Will be an interesting series . we are ready for the revenge Of the loss of our last home series against this Same Indian Team . Oh Australia you beauty ! There is no words to explain this win . No words to explain the amount of good this would do to the team . Every single ball every single shot every ball saved Australia deserved all of those ! And what a way to break our losing streak in these conditions . Apart from Smudge and SOK Gary Starcy Hank Hoff - all of them stood up ! A landmark moment for this team . What is now important is for the team is now to keep the feet on the ground Most of the Indian players got out to non spinning skidders . All that Okeffe had to do was to bowl within the width of the stumps which he did with admirable control . This wake up call was necessary for Indian team which was becoming somewhat complacent . Very poor catching was the reason for Smith to complete a century . India wasted every Review and Kohli has to learn how to go for reviews . Jayant Yadav and Ishant sharma made zero contribution to the team . It will be better for India to replace Ishant with a better pacer and Yadav with a proper batsman . One of the dreadful home lost in the history of test cricket . It looks Indian cricket team are riding back time when they used to get defeated in this fashion . It would have an inning defeat to Bangladesh if they had made this king of spinning pitch against Bangladesh in Hyderabad . Indian fans let's realize that India is a team of sub-standard players . Only Vijay and Rahane can play outside the sub-continent . Sad to see but this was coming . Well done Aussies . Monday morning quarterback here surprisingly on a Saturday . To think that team India can succeed overseas seems farfetched given this batting performance . Preparing rank turners should make Kumble and others ashamed of themselves . Batsmen these days have an IPL mentality which simply can't work in the longer format . Smith proved what a champ he is . O'Keefe simply benefitted from a weak Indian batting lineup not used to playing spin remember SA ? . Not sure why Ishant was picked in the team . India should play 3 spinners like SL . This pitch seems like it needed matting on it for stability . What nonsense drawn up by the Indian braintrust and hope they learn from it and get better pitches . Did hear that the old India quickie Salgaonkar was the curator . Maybe he didn't like fast bowling . Well done aussies . . . The defeats in Srilanks helped australian team to rethink the plan and approach in asian soil . The result they got today is because of the successful preparation for this tour and approach of players application and contribution of new members of team like renshaw handscombOkeefeWade and very improved and matured captaincy from Steve smith . Fully credit to Smith and boys . Over confident Kumble Virat and Team got a wake up call . . What Mr . Bajji will comment now . . . Congrats Team Australia on thrashing Kohli and his Team India exposing the frailties of the team that were papered over by individual brilliance from Kohli or players like Nair in the recent 4-0 home Test series against England in Nov-Dec'16 . This Aussie win can be compared with India's shock win over Australia in Perth that broke the Aussie record-equalling 16 Test winning streak on a fast bowlers' dream pitch against a capable Australian pace attack comprising LeeJohnsonStuart Clark & a fiery Tait . India seemed complacent as we had no preparation to plan our response to the aussies . Unpardonable . I don't think a few changes are going to turn it around . We cd look at bringing in Kuldeep Karun and Pandya in place of Jayant Rahane and Ishant . Ideally wd like to bring in Chahal Pant and someone like Ishaan Kishan . The no1 test team India allegedly well beaten on a pitch where the opening bowlers were spinners and in a mostly empty stadium . If the BCCI and Indian crowds continue to treat Test cricket like this i fear for its future well in India at least Wonder what Anil Kumble brings to the table as a coach besides mouthing inanities . Does he have a say in selection of playing XI ? How much are his inputs worth on the likes of Kohli and Co . ? He is being paid a whooping amount but what and to whom is his accountability ? Rahane and Vijay would continue to play in Bangalore . Karun Nair may replace poor Jayant Yadav not the influential Rahane . Again are 6 batsmen reqd . in India ? Can Indians ever get their team balance right ? Problem is whether 6 batsmen or 5 bowlers the matches are won by one or two only while the rest simply bask in others glory . Kohli-Ashwin and to some extent Jadeja were looming large in the matches against Kiwis and Poms . Once Kohli failed the rest got exposed . It used to be with SRT in 1990s and it is with Kohli now-Over reliance on an individual . Sooner other players pull their socks up better for India as a team . Easier said than done though . Hats off to Australia they outplayed India and deserved that win the best team won no excuses . Getting two 100 scores in each innings didn't help but in particular the first innings made the Aussies go in for the kill even if we made 250 runs it would have been competitive . While all praise is for Smith and O'Keefee but the game was set up for Oz by a brilliant innings by Starc and his two very big wickets of Pujara n Kohli in one over in first innings . India should drop RahaneSahaIshant n Jayant for the next game and bring back ParthivNairBumrah I know and one of MishraKuldeep or Yujvendra Chahal . . I am an Indian and i have been saying this since past 2 years . Preparing rank turners is going to bite you back . 1 . You make your ordinary bowlers look world class . 2 . You need to have batsman to cope with such pitch . We dont have Sachin Dravid and Laxman anymore who were the best players of spin in the world . We now have byproducts of IPL who cannot last more than 20 overs . There is no need for rank turners . Indian pitches take turn and automatically after day 3 . We always used to win in home pitches without preparing rank turners . Hope BCCI understands this . 1 . I think ashwin vijay looks really tired . . . . both should be dropped or rested . 2 . Rahane can't play spin should be replaced with nair . 3 . Saha should improve his batting very tentative should improve his batting . 4 . Rahul should focus on t20 only very inconsitent more interested in style prone to injury should improve his fitneess should be immediately sacked . 5 . pujara should improve considering he play only test 6 . jayant not good enough kuldeep should be replaced if 3 spinners . 7 . Ishant is a joker . 8 . Bring shreyes iyer he & kuldeep can be x factor . Worst ever performance ever by team india . Really shameful disgraceful & pathetic display & application . Disgusting . . . . . . . . . . . . . Oops 800 comms ! Let me finish my turn . A thrashing pasting canning hammering much more etc etc . Now many pundits have been very quiet 4-0 wild predictions innings defeat Aus all out 806045 huh really ? ? look your team now 105 & 107 all out . I guess it is hard to see the keyboard with egg on there faces . Anyway well played boys . I tip my hat to Smithy superstar SOK . Fully deserved no stopping us from here . Congrats AUSTRALIA & keep rocking . Congrats all fans @BOB GLENNOZ AUSSIENSW LUCKYCOUNTRY MERVO MIKEPATT SANJ RVC MARCIO CHRIS et cheers ; Oh Indian supporters ! Your passion is admired but you delusion is derided . How many tests in a row in india have you played ? You are a very good team but maybe not as good ad you believed . Producing pitches like that shows the true difference between the two countries . India only cares about India winning . Remember Ajit Agarkar ? His spell in Adelaide in 2003 ? . India won that match . I remember that we were all cock-a-hoop after that win . End of series . The scoreline was 1-1 . Most importantly how many wickets did agarkar take after that Adelaide test . Lets wait till the end of the series before judging a player . Cricinfo please publish . To all avid cricket fans I'd like to note that on behalf of Australia and all teams that all fans would like even and fair contests . I have no qualms with the pitch presented just that Australia got to bat 1st . It gives a perspective to others minus the [[Q-16]] ! Now that that's taken care of we are all on common ground . I'd like to state that the governing bodies ACA and BCCI etc are pitching us against each other by diluting the true athleticism and skills of opposing teams in a competitive nature by offering up standards of pitches etc which we have no control over . Thereby they pit all of us against each other in an uneven playing field in order to satisfy monetary objectives prescribed by themselves for themselves ! We all need to see the forest for the trees so to speak ! I love that we all as national supporters root for our teams . I dislike however that we are set upon a confrontational result by these bodies . Let's take our game back . I think India deserve to lose . They were over confident for long time . This crushing defeat that affect indian psyche . Finally people realize Kumble is a poor coach . When opposition is as cunning as indian indians will lose because there is lack of focus as group . Indians are skilled its more of working as single minded force is always problem for free spirited indians . I think aussies will sweep all the test matches . If aussie can take kohli wicket it will have domino effect . There is no batsman in indian team other than kohli . Jayant yadav is a big waste . Can't bowl can't bat and leak runs . I can bowl better than him . Only thing mentio . In this kind of pitch odd spin bowler take many wicket because in normal condition he not able to ball spun and this condition ball get some amount of spin and enough to take edge but good bowler to get more spin and bounce and that enough to beat the bat and that is difference . I am not IND fan but why everyone is so critical about kohli and all players and asking them to be dropped . . . etc this is just a bad test match and learn to appreciate winners when you are being beaten by them stop criticising after just one match and back your team for next one . . this is the difference between India fans and other countries fans . . lol I must admit that I fail to understand how 'some observers said the Smith innings was the best hundred they had seen' when he was dropped three times before he got to fifty . Surely number of people could have scored like that with such generosity ? Congrats to Aussie ! I knew they would trouble India after getting 260 in their 1st innings but never expected such a humiliating capitulation by India twice in the same test . Fair to say some of their batter's reputation has taken a beating . First Indians gave too many lives to Smith who needs no second invitation and promptly got the best score of the match . Second I didn't expect much from both Ind openers in their 2nd innings . Vijay got his quota of runs against Eng and BD so he will stay low until the last test to score another half century . Ditto Rahul . Pujara's failure in both innings is the most disappointing of all . This is the type of wkt and challenge a batsmen of his supposed technique and caliber is expected to show what he is made . Know we all know . Its now confirmed Aussies won't be beaten 0-4 in tests . Ex-Indian stalwarts have to come up with a new prediction now . RenshawStark and Smith combined made more runs than the Indian team in both innings . Australia was wise to include two spinners . India with all the talk about spin can't play spin . Now what do they do . . make those grave yard wickets ? Stark and Hazelwood have pace enough to worry batsmen who like to chase wide balls . Great win for Australia . India will have to show the grit that Kholi talked about against England . Comprehensible ! Total domination ! India have been cut down to size authoritatively and masterfully by a team that was expected to routinely crumble into submission to the subcontinental masters of the present just like the visiting teams before them . Will Australia repeat their domination in the matches to follow ? We shall see ! Game on ! How can people say that indian players are tired as once sunil gavasker said how can you be tired of doind something that you love the teuth is they were over confident and the difference can be seen as every single aystralian player gave value to their wicket and the preparation was visible . accept the xefeat and lets just hope that we do a better job next game . Come on . India did not lose by 333 runs . They lost by an innings and 48 runs . India 105 & 107 . Australia 260 . Australia's second innings is something they played for fun . The match was lost when they allowed Australia to 256 for 9 on the first day that too allowing Starc to score 61 . Very shameful . These kids do not know how to play spin they are not very good in fast wickets too that is a different story @ReapWhatYouveSown I call you out . who told you that spinner friendly pitches should not be made for test cricket ? who said only India can/should win in such pitches ? didn't this notion get proved today that all you need is skill ? Isn't this similar like having a pace friendly pitch in Perth where the ball take off from day 1 ? cricinfo please post . IND has generally dominated all teams in all forms of cricket from 2007 onwards with MSD as captain greatest in world cricket history except on a few occasions with No . 1 ranking in test cricket 3 world titles could have 6 with a bit of luck . It is therefore quite natural for fans of some teams to be disappointed . Some may have got temporary relief in tests with IND's 3 losses . Kohli led IND has regained No . 1 ranking in test cricket . Now with IND's big loss v AUS in test 1 at PUNE fans of some teams are making sweeping comments about IND players who are proven performers . IND has the best team battingbowlingfielding resources across all the formats . Kohli without doubt is the best batsman in world . What has worked for AUS is calm captaincyexcellent fielding familiarity with conditions & good preparation . What has not worked for IND is flawed 5 batsmen theory & bunching of too much test cricket in short time . It is time to introspect with better batting coach & fight back Only two failure of kohli and smith is better . Fact is fact kohli is better . Second We are expose everytime when rankturner is there . Clark took 6/8 do you remember in Mumbai . Herath show our weakness in Galle . Now O keefe time . Rank turner is weak link for us . Not fast wicket kohli struck four hundrad in Aus . We won in Perth . And some one ask about winning series in Aus So because of umpiring We never won series . Now drs is come and this thing will change t faith inupcoming tour . And about this series O keefe surprise usSo this is first and last heroic performance in this series by O keefe . Yes in this test match credit goes to ausis . Its a gala time for you . But remember We will back . Need To Rahul replace to parthiv and Saha replace to Nayar . Jayant replace to Mishra/Nadeem and Ishant replace to Bhuvi Or Aron . Rahul is the finest player but issue is fitness and little technical issue Go and take your time And Return with a fitest body . You have a bright future . As a bowler Yadav has no x factor If you add up India's total in the first and second innings of 105 runs and 107 and compare Australia's first innings score of 260 runs then it can be considered an innings and 48 run victory for the Aussies in less than 3 days . I have never seen a team dominate from start to finish and India was totally outplayed in all departments of the game in bowling batting and fielding . Kholi has never surrendered his wicket so easily without a fight in either innings of a match and the pressure was too much even for one of the finest batsman in world cricket . The way he got out in both innings was not by his standards and to say the least just incredible . For some mysterious reason It has taken nearly 6 years for Steve O'Keefe to break into this Australian test team despite being the leading wicket in shield cricket almost every season . As usual India turned out a dust bowl for the Aussies and they themselves fell into this trap severely exposing their own weakness against spin . To all the Indian supporters I put forth this question: why are you surprised that when your team of invisibles heads out of home that they struggle to win ? It is a rhetorical question ! The answer is that you insulate your players from the BCCI and coaches downward ! via what is demanded pitch wise for touring teams . This test result was bound to happen inevitably all on the result of the coin toss and subsequent call . There is much chagrin and pans hung of teeth outside your world as soon as you see a slight green tinge to a pitch . This is a result of your governing body BCCI ! Tis nothing to do with doctoring . If you like I'm sure your next venture to Australian shores we can greet you with a lush and verdant pitch in Brisbane . The only reason that India gets a look in is that Cricket Australia loses $ if a test doesn't go 5 days . Note Steve Waugh's team regularly wrapping up tests in 3 days . On a side note Australia's drop-in pitches are ruining our game ! ie flat tracks Amid the 700-odd comments I will add my twopence worth . The term [[Q-17]] is cliched but if ever there was one . . . Possibly the greatest victory by an Australian side in my 47 years of watching test cricket . 13 years of failure ends in 3 extraordinary days . Sensational unbelievable unrepeatable ! Never has a side been more written off than this Australian one . Take a bow Steve Smith & co ! Smith might just be the finest Australian batsman in the last 50-odd years . Oh and for those in India collectively responsible for pitch preparation: perhaps the expression [[Q-18]] might ring a few bells . Lastly for all that I still expect India to win this series . . . but for the moment exultation in the land of Oz ! indian cricketers should play in bigbash league and england county to get used to their conditions ipl ruining the prestige of indian cricket these indian cricketers getting huge amounts in bidding and not showing intrests in international cricket . Lotsssss of comments ! ! Still I cannot stop my syself . After Bangladesh's loss I said in comments that India is going to lose games against OZ . But I didn't expect so much ! Hmm this is trus Indians batting or Bowling . The team itself batsmen or bowlers are number one in ranking . Only reason is-they are playing at home . England or BD lost because of their confidence losing toss or lots of misses . That's why I said you are gonna lose the tosses lose to games . Probably OZ are going to be real number one team in test . Good luck both of the teams for rests ! ! ! On such pitches if you loose the toss only way to comeback is by taking a lead of 100 runs in the first innings . Then India would have chased less than 200 in the 4th innings . But on the other hand India conceded 155 run lead . It was all down hill from there . Chasing more than 200 in India is a huge challenge . Especially on such pitches . This shows how much Sri Lanka's performance should be appreciated; the match went exactly as was the SL match with the home team collapsing to a hundred but the epic innings by Kusal Mendis made the difference . Also Herath did wonderfully well in the second innings better than much hyped Ashwin & Jadeja . India 's confidence got a dent let's hope will bounce back in the second . Night mare for India . Bad umpiring decisions and India loosing their reviews early . This gifted Australia in retaining wrong umpiring decisions . India and Kohli started their play with over confidence that spinners will take control . This time aus did lot of background job . It's Australia spinners who took control and nation shocked . India should go with Vijay Pujara Rahane Virat Karun Shaha Ashwin Jadeja Hardik Kuldeep Umesh . . . . . . . . Ishant not useful at all and Rahul is a useless investment just like Rohit in test . . . . . Kuldeep for a change in spin . . . . . Hardik at least will bring zeal which is missing in pune test . . . . . . Hope for a great series ahead . . . . . you have to get to pitch of the ball to play it . you let it pitch you are gonna get caught . indians were sitting duck with their rooted footwork . vijay was lucky to survive 10 balls there . aussies had impeccable line . indians looked like a junior team . they got bundled out for 100 twice ! whoever made this pitch need to be fired . it was a minefield . And worked against the home team once they loss the toss . Great performance by Australia and especially Steve Smith Steve O Keefe and Lyon in the second innings . India need to look at their players and decide if this is the best team for the second test . My opinion is that we need to replace Rahane with Karun Nair . Also Bangalore is Nair's homeground and that might another consideration to get him into the squad . I think Kuldeep Yadav would add more value to this squad instead of Jayant Yadav in terms of variety . And Bhuvi coming in for Ishant Sharma would be another suggestion Ishant was the only bowler in the entire Test to go wicketless what has happened to him ? . Hopefully Bhuvi would be able to swing the new ball and get some early wickets . Another radical thought would be to try Hardik Pandya to fill the role of a medium pace all-rounder although I would prefer to have Bhuvi . Also couldn't we have had Hardik Pandya substituting in the fielding department instead of Abhinav Mukund who dropped 2 chances in short order ? After watching the whole test I came to few loop holes which lead us to defeat . . . . . . . . 1 Players look tired specially Ashwin Rahul Rahane Jayant Ishant Vijay . . . . . 2 Only Virat Yadav Jadeja and Shaha showed some intent for fight . . . 3 Ashwin looked most tired and was trying too much variations on pitch was spinning . . . . And In batting also looked drained . . . . Better take a break from cricket . . . . . . 4 Rahul is player taking his place for granted and lost the great platform by throwing his wicket . . . . Health wise he so prone to injury . . . . . Better he should only play T20 . . . . . 5 Rahane looked clueless against the spin . . . . 6 Ishant lookes tired after bowling few overs no pace nothing . . . . . Waste selection . . . . . Serves India right for producing a sub-standard pitch was supposed to favour their spinners but the ploy back-fired bady . Now that the Aussies have spin bowlers that can match the Indians what's the bet that instead of a dust bowl the wicket for the next Test miraculously turns into an absolute road where India hope their batsmen score 600+ I think indian batsman aren't very great players baring kohli he too can't play in challenging condition Most shameful defeat of all time . 1 . Both openers are disgrace once in blue moon players both should be thrown out getting out lbw & then reviewing what a foolish . 2 . Pujara not good enough no . 3 & people were comparing with dravid . 3 . Rahane again not good very tentative . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 . Kohli can only play in flat track . . . 5 . saha not good enough batsman 6 . jadeja/ashwin overbowled by aus spinners is disgraceful 7 . jayant not good enough 8 . Nair should play instead of rahane 9 . Kuldeep yadav should play instead of jayant if going for 3 spinners 10 . Shreyes iyer/mukund should play in team . 11 . Fielding & Kohli captaincy is very bad going through emotion DRS review is the worst among all the team . May be the frail Indian players are really tiredbecause of the tight schedule ! Even against Bangladeshthe spinners were almost ineffective . The fielding looks terrible nowbatting equally inept . The Aussie spin duo reminds me of Swann& Monty and this O[[Q-19]]sporting chance[[Q-20]]fairness[[Q-21]]dry pitches win matches[[Q-22]]Horses for Courses[[Q-23]]See ? When we are at full strength nobody can match us . That why we are the best team in tests and we have won 5 WCs . Our appetite for winning our never say die attitude our attacking flair our athleticism on the paddock and our winners mentality ! ! ! We are superior because Aussies are superior people .

THEY ARE NOT ! ! ! Vijay's technique was exposed against seamer outside the off stump in the first innings dangling bat away from body outside the offstump and it the second innings he was totally at sea against spinner . As for Rahul less said the better - NOT a test opener by any means . Signs of bad form were there all season but management chose to ignore . Will they act at least now and give a chance to someone plucky like Parthiv Patel ? Australia have let their opposition score big totals in the last innings . As little as two months ago they let Pakistan score 450 runs in the last innings in Brisbane . The highest successful chase in a fourth innings was against Australia by minnows West Indies . If anyone can do it we can do it . If it will be done against any team it will be done against Australia . Kohli to get 250 . Time and time again India has shown itself surrender against spin bowling . Whether it be against Panesar or against Sodhi in T20 . Doesn't change the fact that we're the best players of spin and have dominated it for the good part of the last 5 decades . Kohli is saidly loss of the match award . In captaincy why you questioning over umpire decision . both umpire seem upset of this behaviour of kohli . And out come is which boll is out side of stump even hit it middle of stump in australia inningsame situation in india inning and both opener gone . How many time batsmsn not giving outand now you paid the price heavily . Learn the thing umpiring is high class in this match until kohli asking again and again . I don't understand who is supposed to be weak against spin ? All I see is batsman after batsman from Ind hang back and reacting poorly to the pitch rather than judge the length and play accordingly . Same goes for how to bowlers were content to beat the edges rather than go for LBW which seems to be an existential threat to Ind bats EVERY ball ! I am very keen to hear what Kohli says in post match pres today oh yes this is not going beyond 40-50 overs . I don't want to hear excuses like Dhoni for his awful performance Seriously 270 and centuries by ashwin are they going to play in another pitch or the aussies told to bowl under arm balls so they can keep hitting sixes when would people get real this game wont last long at best till lunch tomorrow max india would make 150-200 period Kohli over carriedover positive and over expressingbalance has had missing in captaincy . You show your trump card second over in the match . You just totaly oppositewhat you have did in last series . If you have two fast boler who bowled 140s they deserve to get first spell at first day . Yadav show beauty in last match as a bowler . And you dont give boll in first hour at first day in match . Rahane is good batsmsn better batsman than nayarbut nayar is way better player of spin so why you not choose it specially after triple hundrad . And how many over give to ishantif you think ishant is not fit in your plan so choose bhuvenswar or any batter like nayar . well played Smith ! tough pitch and very good bowling though 4 chances cant take credit out of Smiths batting skills . If Indians ay really well draw will be a good achievement . Win i doubt . Its draw or Aus win . no third possibility . Scoreboard pressure first innings 7-11 ghost Okeef's unexpected spin web all will count . If Indians have to draw their mental application should be 200 times of what they showed in first innings . All the best to both the teams Will the Indian batting ship sink in the second innings again hope not . Hard to believe Indian batsmen are so fragile against spin . Certainly these Australian spin duo look more ominous than Ali and Rashid . If IND could provide this type of pitch rather than a flat Hyderabad pitch to BD we would enjoy a more competetive match . Still IND would remain favourite but it would be more entertaining . Good luck to both teams . Well lets look at the long and short of it . We got 20 wickets despite Ishant being superfluous and us looking a batsman short . Even with no pressure in the second innings it was a good bowling performance . We need to improve the fielding . . . dropping 4 catches and gifting the opposition captain a hundred is appalling and we have not improved over 2 years now . All in all I hope the turners continue even if it means risking the series . We have to go out and win the games to get the trophy back home now . Playing on flat tracks again has improved nothing and brought on complacency . This pitch is only slightly more difficult than the Mumbai pitch against England where we made 600 and we have crumbled under scoreboard pressure . Now I hope they dont make a mockery of things and play a proper second innings . So Australia go 1 up in the series that most expected India to win in a cakewalk . The interesting question now is: What changes will the respective teams make for test 2 ? For India I reckon Ishant has to go and they should bring in a younger quick . For Australia they need to replace the Shaun Passenger with Khawaja and if MM does nuthin this innings wiv de ball mon den he can go owt also and Maxwell can come in Appreciate Team Australia played well in both the innings . Catches will win matches . It was unfortunate that the indian players couldn't grab many sitters . Today at the first hour of play Smith was LBW Jadeja when he was 84 . Umpire ruled out the decision citing the reason as the ball hit the bat first before hitting the pad . Indian team review was nil . The action reply clearly showed the ball hit the pad first . It was plumb in front . Similarly Wade was caught behind in the bowling of Umesh . Honestly the batsman himself should have walked off . But he stayed back and umpire ruled him not out . Since we did not have review wade escaped . Umpiring decisions are pathetic . If there is a doubt or based on the appeals made by the fielding team the umpire may go for third umpire review . He did not do that despite Kohli requested him to do so . Indian batsmen will definitely fight back hard . I wish India to win this match . Ramesh Nagarajan Chennai Smith should buy a lottery ticket today . So lucky to get 100 . Such an annoying batsman for the opposition but mighty effective . I think now India's so called bowling great Harbhajan will not make this kind of prediction . Austrailia deserves to win this game . The way these crop of Indian batsman plays spin on turning wicket Game should end by today . Hopefully this is on off test where India underperformed . as an Indian fan I would like to see Indian victory but can't stop appreciating the Aussies they really outplayed India till now but this is cricket can't predict until the result come still 2 days and 2 sessions to go I feel India still have a chance if they bat with rock determined they are known for that I think we can safely assume that Australia will wrap this match up by the end of day 4 ! This Aussie team no matter how the series pads out have turned things around big time since their lamentable showing in 2015-16 . All the dead wood has gone talent in RenshawHandscomb O Keeffe and Khawaja support for Smith as leader and a world class pace attack . If India pull off a miracle I'll eat my cricket hat . So according to the maths India slaughtered England Australia are about to hammer India . . . which means cometh the ashes England could get a whipping like last time down under . But cricket is a funny fascinating old game isn't it ? Wow 441 Runs lead who would have thought about Australia in such position . Credit to them for preparing well . hiring right people and fighting hard in their 1st innings . They have good fast bowlers and gun fielding unit . And india for some strange reason give them Raging turner their spinners have come into ascendency . 1-0 Australia by tomorrow morning . As an indian fan a bitter pill to swallow but lot to learn from Aussies . Respect from Indian fan . Well played Steve Smith ! A fantastic hundred on a pitch that turned and bounced . I have no problem in holding my hand up and saying Australia have been the better side this match . However stranger things have happened in Test cricket so don't count India out yet .

As an indian fan a bitter pill to swallow but lot to learn from Aussies . Respect from Indian fan . About the pitch itself Kohli said: [[Q-43]]We played good cricket that's why we won . We played bad cricket and that's why we lost . That's how simply we look at this defeat . We just want to take the learnings forward improve and come back stronger in the next game . I can assure you that we are going to come back with more intent for sure and put Australia under pressure straight from ball one . [[Q-44]]We wanted to pick up 20 wickets we did manage to do that[[Q-45]]I mean not in time . I would say we did make breakthroughs but we could've done it quicker and if you don't grab your chances in the second innings if you drop five chances of one batsman then you certainly don't deserve to win . If you get bowled out within 11 runs and lose seven wickets you don't deserve to win a Test match . [[Q-46]] Kohli said Indian saw the defeat as [[Q-47]] . [[Q-48]] Kohli said of the mood in the dressing room . [[Q-49]] against Sri Lanka] we had the most outstanding run after that[[Q-50]]I would say that we needed something like this for us to get a reality check and understand what are the things we need to work on and keep persisting with it . Not take anything for granted at any stage especially at the Test-match level . [[Q-51]]The way we batted in the first innings I think we put ourselves under a lot of pressure to be honest[[Q-52]]Conceding a 160-run lead on that kind of wicket is criminal actually . If we were close enough to their first-innings total the bowlers' mindset is different in the second innings . The moment you give away 50-60 runs the game is drifting away already . [[Q-53]]I think our spinners bowled really well as well[[Q-54]]I wouldn't say what they did better . As I said if you don't apply yourself any bowling attack can look dangerous . It's as simple as that . Even a part-timer can get four wickets if you don't apply yourself . And I certainly would like to think that that was the case with our batting line-up in this game . It rarely happens that four-five batsmen make errors in judgement in both the innings especially with the way we batted in the last few months . I would say this was our worst batting performance and we need to accept that . [[Q-55]]It was a judgement error from my side[[Q-56]]I left the ball too early . I should have waited for the ball a little more . You can't say which ball is going to turn or which isn't . You've got to play the line and I certainly didn't do that . It was my fault . [[Q-57]]carrom ball[[Q-58]]plan[[Q-59]]thrashing[[Q-60]]thrashing[[Q-61]]plan[[Q-62]]It's been a feature of our side's performances over the last year that the younger players have all come in and put in performances straight away which speaks a lot about where the team is at the moment and the culture of the group[[Q-63]]It's always pleasing when some new players are stepping up nor relying on one or two players . [[Q-64]]He has got a phenomenal rate of transferring those fifties to hundreds so I'm sure he'd be disappointed he hasn't got a hundred because he is playing as well as he has ever played . I suppose he would feel a little disappointed in the manner of some of his dismissals . That's the nature of how he plays . [[Q-65]] At this early stage of de Kock's career he already lies sixth on South Africa's ODI century-makers' list above a big name like Graeme Smith . The former captain played 196 ODIs and scored 10 centuries de Kock could go on to double or even treble that . Also below de Kock is After the Christchurch ODI where he was given a chance at No 4 Duminy explained he understood he needed to step up . [[Q-66]] he said . Some pressure for his place may be just what Duminy needs to kickstart a change in fortunes as it did in Tests . After being dropped last summer during the series against England Duminy returned with a much improved mindset and scored two important hundreds in Perth and in Johannesburg to prove he still has plenty to offer . The upcoming Tests will be another chance for Duminy to build on that progress . Eight members of the Test squad who are not part of the limited-overs outfit will arrive in Auckland on Sunday where they will begin a week-long camp . Batting coach Neil McKenzie and fitness trainer Greg King will break away from the ODI group to oversee the Test players' preparations . South Africa do not have a warm-up match before the series starts in Dunedin on March 8 but all their players have been in action in the domestic one-day cup . with South Africa well aware of his importance to every XI . Rabada was left out of the Christchurch game with a knee niggle and returned in Wellington and Domingo has explained that its unlikely Rabada will be given time off with the series still on the line . [[Q-67]] Domingo said . [[Q-68]] If I were SA I'd rest Rabada for the first test and so if Morne still has his magic . Rabada needs a rest to make sure he doesn't burn out and this will give selectors the chance to get a look at Morne's fitness and whether he can get through 15-25 overs in an innings . NZ conditions don't exactly need the greatest bowlers to rip through lineups either as we saw with De Grandhomme who is a medium pace trundler taking 6 for little to nothing against Pakistan that on debut If I were SA I'd rest Rabada for the first test and so if Morne still has his magic .

NZ conditions don't exactly need the greatest bowlers to rip through lineups either as we saw with De Grandhomme who is a medium pace trundler taking 6 for little to nothing against Pakistan that on debut has been ruled out of the Test series against Bangladesh as the hamstring injury that has ailed him since January 22 continues to pose problems . Sri Lanka's selectors are expected to name the Test squad on Tuesday and with it the replacement captain . from touring Zimbabwe in October and November . He had played a substantial amount of cricket in the two years leading up to this period representing Sri Lanka in all three formats as well as leading the team in the 2015 World Cup in last year's World T20 and in Tests . - who had also missed the Zimbabwe tour through injury - may also be considered for the captaincy in this series . Upul Tharanga who led Sri Lanka in the recent ODIs against South Africa and the T20s in Australia represents a third option . Neither Chandimal or Tharanga have previously led Sri Lanka in a Test . This what Aussie Cricbuzz had to say about Tharanga's captaincy in it's talking point; inventive captaincy negated his failure with the bat to make big scores in this t20 series . After taking the reins from an injured Angelo Mathews Smartly Tharanga decided to bowl first in each of the matches which initially seemed a major gamble but ultimately proved a successful strategy . Tharanga rotated his bowlers deftly and used his menacing spinners mid-innings to continually stymie Australia's momentum . Undoubtedly Tharanga outnumbered his opposite number Aaron Finch in a major tick of his leadership . @Crickexp: What nonsense . When Sanga Mahela retired really who should have been the next Captain ? But what happened ? Don't you remember Tharanga was completely eliminated from the scene in mid 2013 for over 2+ straight years hardly allowing even any international exposure . Why ? to Crown much junior Mathews guy as captain . Also juniors like Thiri/Chandi were given zillion chances to fail apart from rewarding the vice captaincy . We all know what happened next sinking series after series in every format . Now It is quite clear why Mathews never allowed UT to come up since then by limiting his career to occasionally given solitary chance here & there with month to year apart in-between layoffs . Eg: Axing for one year just after a Test series defining 92 45 scores in a decider Vs Pk 2014 & despite consecutive near fifties in both innings 48 46 in the solitary test given after a year Vs Pk in Jun 2015 he was axed again in next series & never again allowed to bat in top order . What changed suddenly to consider Chandimal for the captaincy role ? I thought he was told to go back to club cricket and work on his game . No disrespect to Ban but good series to test bench strength . Matthews might benefit from sheddding a few pounds might be the key to managing his injuries . Matthews need to figure this out . He is probably staying out on purpose to prove some point . For sometime he and Chandimal stifled the team by not giving chance to upcoming players . Now he is not getting his way and this is the result . On top of that Karunarathne is doing his usual things to get selected and ruin more test matches for SL .

Now he is not getting his way and this is the result . On top of that Karunarathne is doing his usual things to get selected and ruin more test matches for SL . Dimuth scored today AFTER he was shown the way first by Samarawickrama's good batting . You won't get a better opportunity than team like BD at home to try two new openers which has been our main problem . Even try Dickwella somewhere in the Tests dropping both present openers . At least three players picked for IPL which brings honor and revenue to SL . Let them ready for IPL in good health and both Malinga and Angi should be included only for T20 BD series . Please pick the captain first and let him involve in selecting the test squadDimuth always perform well in practice games and then fails in real test regularlyNevertheless 140 knock by experienced player should be seriously considered for test squad . Hope both Sadeera and Pushpa get rewarded for good performance . My test pool: Dimuth Sadeera Pushpa Asela Sachith Milinda Dhana KMendis UT Niroshan Herath and fulltime spinners and pacers . UT handled well rotating bowlers and setting fielding in last series . UT is unselfish team builder . Please make UT as test captain and keep SL momentum flow forward to bring back the lost SL glory . @ Neilwani agree like to see two new openers . However though Silva did not score big he spent sometime at the wicket in difficult circumstances in SA & he scored a century in the last match in SL against Australia which gave us a win so unlikely he will be dropped . The fact that he is not in the A team like Dimuth points to that he is in the team . There is a campaign going against Mathews and Chandimal led by few seniors who are trying to secure a place in SL team and take over the leadership and void filled by Sanga and Mahela . . when Sanga and Mahela was there everybody else gathered around them and nobody tried to control the team . . now SL cricket team has lost it's control as old players like TharangaMalingaKapugedara/etc trying to take the control of SL cricket Surprised that people are still considering Kaushal Silva as the first choice opening batsman . Selectors must consider Dickwella in Test matches too . Hope Dhananja De Silva and Mendis can regain form during the series . Sri Lanka need a leg spinner in Test matches . The number of days that Mathews is injured is more than the number of days he has played cricket in his career . This shows the level of fitness in the Sri Lankan team . If the captain is that careless of his fitness what example will he set for the youngsters in the team . He should learn some lessons from Virat who is a role model for not just the youngsters of India but also his team-mates . Good oppounity for Tharanga to show his skills . Either Herath or Tharanga should lead the team until chandi grooms bit more . Dimuth is opening batsman option whoever argues . Young players must groom for sometime before they play against test nations . Chandimal can't even get into the team based on his performances . The chief selector himself said he needs to go back to 'club' cricket to work on basics . How can he be in contention for captaincy ? Tharanga is barely making a comeback . I would say Herath is the only option for tests for now . In fact Herath should be asked to withdraw his retirement from short formats . To me he is still the best spinner in SL by some distance . The extended break is not bad with the recent family reasons on the top . However the selectors should closely evaluate the need for his below par bowling role . With his recurrent injuries for whatever reasons looming large Mathew should captain & play purely as a batsman in the Tests . His bowling has been lately very ineffective & his mindset too deviates from taking a much more significant responsibility as a senior batsman . Bowling seems to be his get out option he uses to his advantage when fails in his batting . So we have a captain not playing a significant role in batting & using trundling as an excuse to be in the team . Sri Lankan team will gain more if Mathew plays only as a senior batsman in the Tests so the selectors have to look for more effective bowling options instead . Do we still need to consider Mathews to captaincy . With such a poor fitness level we will have to regularly consider replacements to captain . Because once he gets fit he will bowl in that tour and he will lose the shape to bat . By the end of the tour he is getting injured again and lose another one or two series . Give this guy a rest and concentrate on his batting . Because he is the best middle order batsman we have at the moment . Make new captains for the shorter and longer formats . Mathews always try to bowl if he is the captain . I think he should be released from the captaincy burden and nurture as a pure batsman . @A . JAYAWARDENE totally agree with you mate . Just before the last Zim tour Dimuth scored a century and got selected again . It seems Dimuth is doing the same thing here again . I don't know why Sanath is so keen on bringing him to the team . He has got enough opportunities and never has proved himself . I think Ron Sadeera and Pushpakumara should get the chances in the squad . Even though Malinda is also a left arm spinner he also should be in the team because BD may have well prepared for Herath . Herath should captain as Chandimal's form has been poor since his return after injury . Sri Lanka have been found wanting many times for allowing players straight into the team after injury without a proper assessment . Chameera's & his form in SA are two good examples . If Chandimal plays in the first & flops the selectors should keep the door open to drop him from the second . On other hand don't burden him with captaincyeven the vice captaincy burden did not go well with him . That is big loss for SL . Mathews is one of the most consistent batsman that SL has . Hope he recovers well . BD is a very good team with lot of experience and many young talents . I think Herath should lead the team as he is the most experienced player . SL XI: Dimuth Kaushal Tharanga Mendis Asela Chandiwk Dananjaya HerathC Pushpakumara Lakmal Prasad If he is not fit Pradeep Rest of the squad: ChameeraIf not fit Sanjaya Dilruwan or Sandakan Sadeera Can play as a wicke keeper batsman Drop Dimuth he scored some runs today just as he did against WI A & got a trip to Zim & SA . Now will he be given another extended run for the umpteenth time ? Why was he picked for the second A game when he was out for zeroes in the first . It is a MUST we introduce a new face as an opener at home against lowly BD so that new one can find his feet . Either Chandragupta or Samarawickrama should be given a chance . We are getting India in the summer & Dimuth had a horrendous tour against them last time . At least one new opener should be tested against BD . Kandi moon thank u very much good luck for Bangladesh too bcz u become a top team thanks to our coaching staff so this will be a eye catching series and i want Herath to lead in tests Tharanga to lead in odis and Malinga to lead in t20s when Mathews come back he can lead the test side but not the odis give Tharanga a consistent run in odis bcz he is our best player in odis at the moment close to 6000 runs and 14 hundreds I don't understand why people hate Chandimal this much . He failed in SA test series where all SL batsman were failed to contribute with their bats . He needed a break from cricket for a while and he had enough of it . while Angelo isn't there in the middle SL need someone who has experience in International arena to lead the batsman to glory . We saw it in past England and Australia series as well . Chandimal is the ideal person to lead SL with his game reading ability in the middle . Rangana might be an experienced campaigner but we need someone to groom after Angelo . don't we ? Bangladesh is a very good team and performed really well in NZ . I think they have the team chemistry which is very important in team sports . On the other hand SL is struggling to find 11 players who can play well together Angelo's absence make things harder for SL . He brings stability to middle order batting . I think he should focus on batting and not too much on bowling if were to prolong his career . This will be a good series to watch Sadeera Samarawikrama is hitting century after century in first class matches and against england lions now he is 177 not out . This guy was really impressive in U19 and never looked back from there he just continue to score . Unfortunately ron chandraguptha got out today he also had a very good run in first class and batted well against England lions in series starter . These guys can be the solution for the dimuth kaushal kusal tharanga problem we currently have . Thanks to the almighty that the Indian fans are dejected after the historical loss against Aussies or else they would have mock our teams through out the comment section . Waiting for a good sporting series . BD fans have always great love the SL team . If Mathews is unavailable captaincy could be given to Herath with Tharanga as vice captain . In the absence of Mathews we need some experience in the batting since we cannot take Bangladesh team lightly how they performed in NZ . Hence last & last opportunity could be given to openers Karunaratne/Kaushal Silva . Moreover recent performance of Roshan Silva/Udara Jayasundera were not up to the mark . My squad for the test series is; 1 . Karunaratne 2 . Kaushal Silva 3 . Tharanga 4 . Kusal Mendis 5 . Chandimal 6 . Dhananjaya de Silva 7 . Dickwella 8 . Asela Gunaratne 9 . Herath 10 . Dilruwan Perera 11 . Lakshan Sandakan 12 . Chameera 13 . Lakmal 14 . Pradeep 15 . Lahiru Kumara or Prasad if fit . @ SL supporter : Sorry buddy . Dimuth will be opening the innings as SJ needs to give him a chance to hit back to form so that Dimuth can be in the team forever . But not to worry . Fizz is there a Dimuth wont last long against the strong BD attack and fail in both games . After about 20 such failures Dimuth might get dropped No issue Rangana should lead the team . But if that is the case Malinda Pushpakumara may not be picked who deserves a place in the team unfortunately he is also a slow left arm spinner like Rangana . I think both Chandimal & Tharanga don't deserve places in the team . Niroshan can keep wickets & Asela should be picked for Mathews's place . Both Kusal Mendis & Dhananjaya De Silva should be given an extended run . My test team 1Kaushal 2Dimuth 3Mendis 4Dhananjaya 5Milinda Siriwardana 6Asela 7Niroshan 8Herath 9Dhammika Prasad 10Sandaken 11Lahiru Kumara ODI team 1Niroshan 2Munaweera 3Mendis 4Dhananjaya 5Angelo 6Milinda 7Asela 8Malinga 9Aponso/Malinda Pushpakumara 10Lahiru Kumara 11Chameera T20 Team 1Niroshan 2Munaweera 3Kusal Janith 4Angelo 5Kapugedara 6Milinda 7Asela 8Malinga 9Kulasekara 10Aponso/Malinda Pushpakumara 11Chameera/Lahiru Kumara . Big blow for SL . but its also eciting to see what playaers can fill his role . I hope at least one of our openers are gone and replaced with someone new . Not sure whether Chandimal will play because sanath said he needs to go back to club cricket . thats not really something you would say if he was coming back into the team straightaway . Would like to see Dickwella play and also Samarawickrama come in who was being doing really well recently . He got promoted to the A team for the first time and is currently at 120 not out against the England Lions . I wonder if chandimal even gets picked in the squad . What's he done since getting dropped in SA to get a place in the team . He tries to keep wickets to pretend he contributes to the team in another way when the real reason is he's a crappy fielder and doesn't want to be in the outfield . This keeps other talented players out of the team as well as he himself becomes a weight for the others to carry . Regarding Matthews he should be ready in time for the upcoming IPL season so can't risk playing for his national team . Both Matthews and Chandimal are 2 over-rated players in my mind . When will Mathews learn he needs to lose weight . Malinga Thisara have had injury problems and it's been mainly due to their weight and having to do a lot of running when you've got 95-110kg weighing you down instead of the 75kg or so that Chandimal probably weighs is going to injure you consistently . Class player but Mathews really just seems laid back sometimes guarantee though he'll be ready for his IPL stint . When will Mathews learn he needs to lose weight .

He got promoted to the A team for the first time and is currently at 120 not out against the England Lions . T20 run fests are great fun but nothing quite beats a nail-biter specially when a team has something at stake . This was the format at its raw cruel best where one swing of the blade meant wildly fluctuating fortunes for Pakistan cricket's two biggest powerhouses . Two swings of the blade actually . Karachi Kings' who hadn't fired in the tournament until today struck two sixes off the last two balls of the match to ensure his side's hopes of making it to the playoffs were not yet extinguished . In doing so he left Lahore Qalandars on the verge of first-round elimination again . The run chase of 156 had looked comfortable at the start for Karachi . Babar Azam paired up first with Mahela Jayawardene - who replaced Chris Gayle in the starting XI - and then with Kumar Sangakarra to ensure they were in control of the required rate and had wickets in hand . But accurate bowling from Lahore's spin pair of Sunil Narine and Yasir Shah starved Karachi of boundaries and as the asking rate began to rise so did the tension . Sangakarra's men lost their heads in the middle briefly with Ravi Bopara and Shoaib Malik running themselves out in a space of a few overs . Pollard and Imad Wasim then came together in a partnership that always seemed like they had slightly too much to do never more so than when they needed 10 to win off the last two balls . Pollard was up to the task and took 12 runs . Lahore will rue their own batting performance - an innings that never quite managed to gain momentum for which the batsmen had only themselves to blame . Poor shot selection at inopportune times kept pegging them back with Brendon McCullum Umar Akmal and Grant Elliott falling in similar fashion slicing the spinners up in the air . Shoaib Malik deserved credit for his 2 for 21 which helped ensure Lahore's total was just within reach . Lahore had a decent platform of 68 for 2 at the end of their first nine overs with McCullum appearing to ease himself back into form . Then between the 10th and 15th overs the innings completely unravelled as Lahore lost four wickets for 29 runs in 28 balls . Their most threatening players were back in the pavilion just when the innings should have begun to take off . It wasn't down to outstanding bowling either; with the exception of Shoaib Malik no Karachi bowler really bowled out of their skins . Instead they waited for Lahore to make mistakes and the batsmen did just that . Karachi had made it hard for themselves by losing five wickets for 103 by the end of the 15th over three of them to run-outs . With the asking rate hovering over twelve for the last four overs it increasingly appeared that the only thing standing between Karachi and elimination was the burly figure of Keiron Pollard . He hit at least one boundary in each of the last four overs ensuring that even though the required rate was steep it did not become insurmountable . Imad played a diligent hand ensuring Pollard got as much of the strike as possible . The partnership kept Karachi in the game even when 10 required off the last two balls . The hapless Aamer Yamin slightly missed his yorker in both deliveries on both of them . If it wasn't for Pollard's late show this game would likely have been remembered for McCullum's tactics in the field . He was unusual at times downright funky with his bowling selections . Fakhar Zaman was handed the ball for the 13th over with Babar Azam in good touch and three balls later the batsman holed out on the boundary . Two overs later McCullum brought himself on presumably for no other reason except to have someone to turn the ball away from the left-handed Imad . That over went for 13 and half an hour later McCullum suddenly didn't look quite so clever . Karachi pipped Lahore to fourth place and unless they lose by a massive margin to Islamabad United tomorrow they will go through to the playoffs . Lahore who have dropped down to fifth are staring at the likelihood of first-round elimination for the second successive season .

Dear Writer - pls recalculate your workings Thanks Atifansari1974@gmail . com the platform to win a game for his side once more . In a contest between two teams where it looked like neither wanted to win at times Afridi scored a 23-ball 45 to give Peshawar Zalmi a last-over two-wicket win over first-place Quetta Gladiators . The chase of 129 appeared comfortable for Peshawar near the halfway mark whatever demons the pitch contained . But it was the demons in the mind that really frightened Darren Sammy's men and as has been the theme of the competition over the last few days Peshawar found a way to complicate a straightforward chase . Five wickets were lost for two runs over 12 balls as Quetta looked like they were about to do to Peshawar what Peshawar had done to Lahore on Friday . Then Afridi - yes Afridi ! - restored some sanity to proceedings in a crucial 37-run partnership with Mohammad Hafeez before taking charge of the run chase . He threatened to run out of partners and overs but finished the match with two fours off the first two balls of the 20th . When a collapse of the magnitude that struck Peshawar today happens it's not unusual for a side to crumble altogether . So when 50 for 1 became 52 for 6 it was imperative for Peshawar to slow things down and take the sting out of the game so heads could be cleared and brains unscrambled . Hafeez and Afridi played a vital role for the 6 . 3 overs they were together . They might have added only 37 runs in that period but in a small chase the asking rate was never going to be as much of a problem as the wickets in hand . When Hafeez finally nicked That it was a good pitch for the spinners was fairly obvious but what most caught the eye were the bowling efforts of Wahab and Hasan whose combined figures of 8-0-39-4 were testament to their excellence . Hasan was impressive at both top and tail of the innings varying his pace intelligently and nailing the yorker almost on command in addition to taking three catches . Wahab's most impressive attribute was his raw pace and bounce in the death overs which was simply too good for Peshawar's middle order as they began to lose wickets in a heap . A perhaps unintentional contribution from Wahab came in the dismissal of Umar Gul who went off rubbing his hand and didn't bowl an over during Peshawar's innings . In a game of small margins such as this one Zulfiqar Babar will look back at his first over and think he might have done better . Defending 128 Quetta would have wanted a good start but Zulfiqar mildly put failed to provide them that . The first four balls of the innings all went for wides . One even escaped Sarfraz and cost Quetta a couple of extra runs and it wasn't until the fifth ball went down that a legitimate delivery had been bowled . The over included one more wide after that and despite only four runs coming off the bat Peshawar had eleven on the board at the end of their first over . It might not have been decisive but it certainly wasn't helpful . [[Q-69]] Hesson said . [[Q-70]] [[Q-71]] he said in reference to whether the Tests were a priority . [[Q-72]] [[Q-73]] Hesson said . [[Q-74]] has also been added to the squad after the considerable assistance that was on offer in the opening game of the series . Kane Williamson expects a different surface this time with better weather in the build-up but Patel who played his first ODI in seven years against Bangladesh in Nelson on New Years Eve provides a specialist bowler who can spin the ball away from the left handers . However it could be that Williamson is entrusted with a greater bowler role in the fourth ODI . [[Q-75]] Hesson said . [[Q-76]] I don't understand why not just open with Broom ? I've noticed he bats there in domestic cricket so why not try him there in internationals if that's where he's had his success ? Nothing against Brownlie but he was the second pick after Broom so ideally he should be the preference until he loses form or can't meet expectations . As for Latham it seems Hesson is impatient in putting together a squad . A few bad matches for anyone and they'll be dropped but then brought back in as soon as others fail . Sorry but unless Williamson and Taylor rack on the centuries and Boult takes 5fors they won't do too well in the CT2017 . You need an opener and a keeper hesson . The answer to your problems are staring you in the face but you're not brave enough to trust a 20 year old you'd rather back someone who has let you down time and time again I just don't get it . and if Patel plays ahead of sodhi I'll be even more perplexed just a hint worker is a pretty handy spinner too . Neesham & Grandhomme are both doing extremely well but I think there's only room for one . Very tough call . Broom strengthens that middle order a lot & I think two specialist spinners are needed here . 1-Guptill 2-Brownlie 3-Kane 4-Roscoe 5-Broom 6-Ronchi 7-Neesham/Grandhomme 8-Santner 9-Southee 10-Boult 11-Sodhi . Why pick Patel when you have Sodhi in the side and he is doing really well in this series . Are you going to play 3 spinners . As far as Ronchi is concerned he is struggling more than most and wont do any better 1Guptil2Brownlie 3Williamson 4Taylor 5Neesham 6de Granshomme 7Latham 8Santner 9Sodni 10Southee 11Boult . Gup can win a match on his own if he bats deep . Let's hope he can for the sake of the series . I think I can hear the gnashing of kiwi teeth at the mention of ronchi from over here in Brisbane . I hope ronchi plays if only for Latham's sake . A restfor santner might not be the worst idea although that seems unlikely from Hesson's comments . 1 Guptill 2 Brownlie 3 Kane 4 Ross 5 Neesham 6 CDG 7 Luke Ronchi 8 Mitchy 9 Jeetan/Sohdi 10 Lockie 11 Boult . Lockie gets the new ball . Would be unorthodox but very interesting . If Jeetan is selected ahead of Sodhi it will send a clear messsage to Sodhi that he will not a play a role in the CT most likely which will honestly be a bummer . Maybe give Santner a rest and play the other two tweakers . Playing 3 frontline spinners would be a treat to watch though . If Lockie can improve his accuracy he can be our Kagiso Rabada . I dont think Southee deserves the new ball but knowing the selectors hell still get the new ball . I don't understand why not just open with Broom ?

A restfor santner might not be the worst idea although that seems unlikely from Hesson's comments . 1 Guptill 2 Brownlie 3 Kane 4 Ross 5 Neesham 6 CDG 7 Luke Ronchi 8 Mitchy 9 Jeetan/Sohdi 10 Lockie 11 Boult . Lockie gets the new ball . Would be unorthodox but very interesting . If Jeetan is selected ahead of Sodhi it will send a clear messsage to Sodhi that he will not a play a role in the CT most likely which will honestly be a bummer . Maybe give Santner a rest and play the other two tweakers . Playing 3 frontline spinners would be a treat to watch though . If Lockie can improve his accuracy he can be our Kagiso Rabada . I dont think Southee deserves the new ball but knowing the selectors hell still get the new ball . 1 Guptill 2 Brownlie 3 Kane 4 Ross 5 Neesham 6 CDG 7 Luke Ronchi 8 Mitchy 9 Jeetan/Sohdi 10 Lockie 11 Boult .

Are you going to play 3 spinners . As far as Ronchi is concerned he is struggling more than most and wont do any better 1Guptil2Brownlie 3Williamson 4Taylor 5Neesham 6de Granshomme 7Latham 8Santner 9Sodni 10Southee 11Boult . Neesham & Grandhomme are both doing extremely well but I think there's only room for one . Very tough call . Broom strengthens that middle order a lot & I think two specialist spinners are needed here . 1-Guptill 2-Brownlie 3-Kane 4-Roscoe 5-Broom 6-Ronchi 7-Neesham/Grandhomme 8-Santner 9-Southee 10-Boult 11-Sodhi . You need an opener and a keeper hesson . The answer to your problems are staring you in the face but you're not brave enough to trust a 20 year old you'd rather back someone who has let you down time and time again I just don't get it . and if Patel plays ahead of sodhi I'll be even more perplexed just a hint worker is a pretty handy spinner too . I don't understand why not just open with Broom ? I've noticed he bats there in domestic cricket so why not try him there in internationals if that's where he's had his success ? Nothing against Brownlie but he was the second pick after Broom so ideally he should be the preference until he loses form or can't meet expectations . As for Latham it seems Hesson is impatient in putting together a squad . A few bad matches for anyone and they'll be dropped but then brought back in as soon as others fail . Sorry but unless Williamson and Taylor rack on the centuries and Boult takes 5fors they won't do too well in the CT2017 .
