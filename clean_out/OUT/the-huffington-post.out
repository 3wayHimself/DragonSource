We need an independent prosecutor Maher said later . And Jeff Sessions should recuse himself the same way Loretta Lynch recused herself because he was a part of the Trump campaign is that correct ? Maher asked referring to former Attorney General Lynch and Heres the reason were going to have to do it Bill the congressman said . There may or may not be fault but the American people are beginning to understand that Putin murders his enemies sometimes right in front of the Kremlin . . . hes murdered people and taken down using cyber warfare in Georgia and Ukraine . Acting at the behest of the White House the officials made calls to news organizations last week in attempts to challenge stories about alleged contacts between members of President Trumps campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives U . S . officials said . The White House on Friday acknowledged those interactions with the FBI but did not disclose that it then turned to other officials who agreed to do what the FBI would not participate in White House-arranged calls with news organizations including The Washington Post . The officials broadly dismissed Trump associates contacts with Russia as infrequent and inconsequential . But the officials would not answer substantive questions about the issue and their comments were not published by The Post and do not appear to have been reported elsewhere . White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed that the White House communicated with officials with the aim of contesting reporting on Russia but maintained that the administration did nothing improper . When informed by the FBI that [the Russia-related reporting] was false we told reporters who else they should contact to corroborate the FBIs version of the story he said . The effort also involved senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia including Sen . Richard Burr R-N . C . and Rep . Devin Nunes R-Calif . the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees . A spokesman for Nunes said that he had already begun speaking to reporters to challenge the story and that at the request of a White House communications aide Chairman Nunes then spoke to an additionalreporter and delivered the same message . In an interview Burr acknowledged that he had conversations about Russia-related news reports with the White House and engaged with news organizations to dispute articles by the New York Times and CNN that alleged repeated or constant contact between Trump campaign members and Russian intelligence operatives . Administration officials said that Priebuss comments had been cleared by FBI Director James B . Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe . In doing so the FBIs leadership would appear to have been drawing a distinction between authorizing comments by a White House official and addressing the matter themselves . I am consulting with members of the Intelligence Committee to determine an appropriate course of action so we can ensure that the American people get the thorough impartial investigation that they deserve free from White House interference Warner said in a statement Friday night . Rep . Adam B . Schiff Calif . the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement Friday evening saying that if the White House contrived to have intelligence officials contradict unfavorable news reports this represents a new and even more grave threat to the independence of the intelligence community . Former intelligence officials expressed concern over the blurring of lines between intelligence and politics with some recalling Republican accusations that the Obama administration had twisted intelligence in its accounts of the 2012 attacks on U . S . facilities in Benghazi Libya . I doubt that there was any enthusiasm from the intelligence leadership to get involved in this in the first place former CIA director Michael Hayden said noting that it seemed unlikely that Priebuss bluntly worded denials were consistent with the precise language favored by intelligence analysts . Think Benghazi here Hayden said in an interview by email . This is what happens when the intel guys are leaned on for the narrative of the political speakers . The latter have different rules words purposes . Getting intel into that mix always ends unhappily [and] it looks like we just did . White House officials declined to comment on the administrations subsequent effort to enlist other government officials and would not agree to allow the identification of the intelligence officials who had spoken to The Post last week . In separate calls those individuals insisted on being identified only as a senior intelligence official in the Trump administration and a senior member of the intelligence community . In a brief interview on the night of Feb . 15 the senior intelligence official said that the suggestion that there was frequent contact between Russians and Trump associates was false describing any conversations as sporadic limited and based on Russias interest in building a relationship with the future Trump administration rather than shaping the 2016 presidential race . The senior intelligence official appeared to be referring to contacts between Trumps designated national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump was sworn in as president . Flynn was forced out of his job earlier this month after The Post reported that Officials at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on whether senior officials at those agencies had discussed Russia coverage with the White House or been involved in efforts to refute stories on that subject . It is not unusual for CIA leaders to have contact with news organizations particularly about global issues such as terrorism or to contest news accounts of CIA operations . But involving the agency on alleged Trump campaign ties to Russia could be problematic . The CIA is not in charge of the investigation . Given the history of domestic espionage abuses in the United States CIA officials are typically averse to being drawn into matters that involve U . S . citizens or might make the agency vulnerable to charges that it is politicizing intelligence . U . S . intelligence reports cite multiple contacts between members of Trumps team and Russians with links to the Kremlin during the campaign and afterward according to officials who have seen them . Such reports were based on intercepted Russian communications and other sources the officials said . Nunes who served as a member of Trumps transition team has resisted calls for his House committee to investigate alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russia . He said in an interview that after months of investigations U . S . authorities have turned up no evidence of such contacts . You have to understand that on the emotional level a lot of people liked Keiths message and liked the idea of the dramatic change said Jacobs chair of the Nassau County Democratic Party on Long Island . On the more intellectual level we had a sense and I think this is what a lot of folks had a sense that this would shift the party too far to the left . That was the back and forth . Other DNC members who backed Perez cited reasons unrelated to policy or ideology . Massachusetts DNC member David OBrien pointed to Perezs experience running large organizations and said he was impressed with Perez on a personal level having heard from him repeatedly in recent weeks . The fact that [Perez]said he wanted to change the culture [at the DNC] the fact that he has campaigned at the local level the fact that he has run an organization and the way someone campaigns is instructive as to how they would govern OBrien said . Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown U . S . Air Force veteran Sam Ronan media strategist Jehmu Greene and attorney Peter Peckarsky withdrew after the first round of voting on Saturday . Ronan and Peckarsky endorsed Ellison while Greene threw her support to Perez . South Bend IndianaMayor Pete Buttigieg dropped out just before voting began without endorsing anyone . Shortly after Perezs victory Obama issued a statement congratulating him . I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big bold inclusive dynamic America we love so much Obama said .
