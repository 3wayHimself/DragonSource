These eels can take up to 20 years to mature upon which they'll swim toward the Sargasso Sea . Though scientists haven't observed spawning which they're thought to do at great depths they have recorded pulses of eel larvae coming from that direction . A tiger farm is a facility that breeds tigers like livestock . While alive the tigers attract tourists who come to gawk at the animals and even take selfies . Cubs in particular are a draw encouraging speed breeding in which cubs are taken away from their mothers at a young age forcing the females to go into heat again sooner than they would in nature . Tigers are later slaughtered for the luxury and medicinal markets . Farms range from small operations to industrial-size facilities like those in China . They may be promoted as zoos or sanctuaries such as Thailands infamous Tiger Temple a popular tourist destination that was Some believe erroneously that tiger bone wine which is made by steeping the animals bones in rice wine will impart the drinker with the animals strength . Sellers have found many ways to get around Chinas tiger wine ban including simply taking the word tiger off the label . Bones are also ground into a powder and turned into pills often sold as a cure for rheumatism . And tiger penis is said to be an aphrodisiac . at a meeting of the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES agreeing that tigers should not be bred for trade in their body parts and saying that tiger farms should be scaled back . Numerous reports have subsequently shown however that both the domestic and international trade in tiger parts has grown . Trade in parts and derivatives of captive-bred tigers perpetuates the desirability of tiger products in turn stimulating poaching of wild tigers Debbie Banks of the Environmental Investigation Agency a London-based NGO told National Geographic in October . I later learnedthe inauguration of the citys first bike box a designated space for cyclists to wait at an intersection . That was in 2009 . Cycling continued to grow in the following years . By 2015 San Franciscans took an estimated 82000 bike trips per day and the total length of the citys bike lanes was 125 miles and growing . The maps in this post come from an earlier time when cycling mania swept the nation: the 1890s . The bicycle as we know itwith two wheels of equal size among other featureshad just been invented . Bikes really took off in cities because they provided the first affordable private transportation says Evan Friss an urban historian at James Madison University . Horses were expensive and cars by and large didnt exist yet . Friss writes that the bicycle gave middle-class people more freedom to travel when and where they wanted . It allowed them to get around the city more efficiently but perhaps more importantly in an era of rapid industrialization and urban population growth it allowed them to escape it . Then as now bicycle advocates pushed for road improvements and for dedicated lanes and paths for bike traffic . Local cycling clubs sprang up around the country Manhattan alone had more than 50 and in 1897 the League of American Wheelmen boasted more than 100000 members . The most significant early bike path in the country was the Coney Island Cycle Path which ran five and a half miles from Prospect Park in Brooklyn to Coney Island its shown in the map at the top of this post . Completed in 1895 it epitomized the intent of many bike paths of the erato give urbanites an easy way to get out of the city for the day . Even grander plans were proposed including an illuminated aerial bicycle highway in Chicago; a 40-mile toll route connecting Baltimore and Washington D . C . ; and even a transcontinental route between San Francisco and New York . None of these came to pass . Construction did begin on a proposed nine-mile elevated bikeway between Los Angeles and Pasadena see photo below but the project was never completed . on lists of the most bikeable cities . Last year it opened a new bike-friendly bridge across the Willamette River debuted a $10 million bike-share program and approved a gas tax that will provide $28 million over four years for safety improvements for cyclists and pedestrians . Portland had plenty of bike paths even back in 1896 as you can see in the map below . This 19th-century map is a source of inspiration for modern bike maps says Matthew Hampton senior cartographer for Metro the regional government of Portland and its suburbs . The cycling craze of the 1890s died out as suddenly as it started but the rise of the automobile wasnt the main reason Friss says . He argues that it was more of a cultural shift: Cycling was a cool new thing that became less cool when more people started doing it . The hypermasculine men who adopted cycling as a sport early on began to see it as less sporting as more women began to ride Friss says . The wealthy people who formed cycling clubs and organized fancy promenades began to see cycling as less exclusive as poorer people began to ride . The current enthusiasm for urban cycling seems to have some staying power Friss says but it may not last forever . The bike movement has been tied to a broader urban renaissance in the last two decades but such social movements come and go he says . If the desire for city living starts to wane or if autonomous cars change the way people get around bicycles may once again fall by the wayside . Think of pasta and you think of Italy and a rich menu of mouth-watering dishes . . . Cannelloni Ravioli Macaroni and more . Italy is the undisputed cultural heartland of pasta exporting it as a central pillar of its cuisine that has become common in homes almost everywhere . There are over 300 different types of pasta and more than three times as many names for them depending on your country region and even your town . But all true Italian pasta has one thing in common: it is made from durum wheat . Whereas pasta was once the preserve of the Italian nobility today it is ubiquitous across society and the world . Indeed as a low cost easy to cook and nutritious food that is also versatile and tasty pasta is a popular option for people living on a budget . And that makes durum wheat an important staple crop both now and looking to the future . Every day the world has 200000 more mouths to feed as we advance towards a population estimated to reach 9 . 5 billion by 2040 . Feeding so many people without devastating the planets already strained natural resources is a global challenge and one to which Syngenta is wholly committed . Wheat grown for bread is different to wheat grown for pasta . Cereal growers must meet stringent quality criteria according to the end-use of their crop: for pasta production durum wheat must have a protein content of 14% . However strange though it might seem Italy is struggling to produce enough good quality durum wheat that meets this criterion . Syngenta is therefore working with Italian farmers to improve both the quality and the quantity of their durum wheat production through a project called Grano Armando . Syngenta has brought together an array of technologies from genetics to disease prevention to create a specific cultivation protocol called Armando . This sustainably delivers very high-quality durum wheat enabling farmers to grow more and better durum wheat for the production of pasta . The results are tangible: the projects 1000 growers have experienced a 15% increase in productivity and an enhanced protein content of 14% as opposed to the Italian average of 12% . Central to Grano Armando is Syngentas establishment of a beneficial network across the pasta supply chain connecting individual and often isolated farmers with seed producers and pasta manufacturers including the flagship brand of Grano Armando itself . This co-operative collaboration is stimulating the creation of more suitable and more profitable product allowing farmers to get the best out of their crop and earn a reliable income in a sustainable way . This in turn is revitalizing entire agricultural communities . It is only fitting that a pilot scheme for pasta be trialled in Italy: but Italy is only the beginning . Syngenta is developing Grano Armando as a scalable solution that could see the cultivation protocol distributed worldwide . With wheat currently the worlds second largest food crop after rice and the worlds largest crop by acreage the benefits of introducing or improving high-quality durum wheat on a global scale are obvious . By putting pasta on the plates of more people across the planet Syngenta is making a positive contribution to the global efforts that will sustainably feed future generations and feed them well . Feline hybrids arent found in nature . Lions and tigers dont overlap in the wild except in Indias Gir Forest where until now no ligers have been found . And big cats in the same territory dont cross the species linetheyre not interested in each other just as humans arent drawn to chimps . Instead these animals are the offspring of big cats that crossbreed in captivity and they're destined to become curiosities in zoos and wildlife parks . While it might seem fun to see one of these oddballs in the flesh advocates of big cat conservation say this hybridization has a dark side . According to the association zoos today are supposed to be arks for threatened animals and educate the public about conservation efforts . Propagating animals that specifically do not represent the normal characteristics and variation of the species creates a confused educational message states the associations While we know that lions and tigers have yet to get frisky in the wild its certainly possible for two species to produce a hybrid in nature . Hybridization occurs among carnivores in the wild when the reproductive opportunities become really really limited Hunter says . the offspring of wolves and coyotes number in the millions in the U . S . and eastern Canada . Deforestation hunting and poisoning of wolves in the east meant that they increasingly bred with coyotes spreading into eastern wolf territory from the U . S . Southwest . Though he took the photo in 2012 Candisani says he is publishing the photograph with National Geographic now because the swamps in which these anacondas live are under increasing threat by wildfire and the proximity of agriculture . Environmentalists want the swamps protected by a conservation unit . A solar eclipse occurs when Earth the moon and the sun line up perfectly so that the moon casts a shadow on our planet . However the moon follows an elliptical orbit around Earth and over time the distance between the two objects can vary . For sky-watchers that means the apparent size of the lunar disk in the sky changes too . A total solar eclipse happens when the moon is close enough to Earth that it seems to completely cover up the sun . Annular eclipses occur when the moon is farther from Earth and appears to be smaller than the visible disk of the sun so it does not cover up our star completely . that occurred earlier this month in northern California was a result of poorly constructed and ill-maintained spillways . More than 180000 people were evacuated over fears that the dam's weir would collapse and cause major flooding for communities downstream . Luckily for Lake Berryessa its spillway has yet to see signs of deterioration and it has become a popular sight-seeing spot for locals . The spillway has a number of nicknames including the morning glory spillway and the glory hole although King notes these monikers have become less common since the sixties . Payet frequently photographs and films the volcanos ever-changing landscapes and pyrotechnic displays . Its uncomfortable occasionally dangerous work: Sometimes noxious belches of sulfur dioxide require him to pilot his drone while wearing a gas mask .
