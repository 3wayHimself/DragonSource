ATLANTA Democrats elected former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as their new national chairman on Saturday over a liberal Minnesota congressman after a divisive campaign that reflected the depths of the party's electoral failures as well as the energy from resistance to President Donald Trump . The chair campaign was uncharted territory as Democrats face a power deficit not seen in nine decades . Republicans control the White House Congress and about two-thirds of U . S . statehouses . The GOP is one Senate confirmation fight away from a conservative majority on the Supreme Court . With Democrats in agreement in their opposition to Trump the race turned on who was able to convince enough DNC members to believe his promises of rebuilding party infrastructure that withered under President Barack Obama despite his personal electoral success . Ellison told voting members he had signatures from 750000 rank-and-file Democrats who support his chairmanship bid . He promised to [[Q-1]] He pledged to prioritize small donations to finance the party while working to [[Q-2]]Perez got into the race at Obama's urging but he pushed back on the notion that represented the same [[Q-3]] label that dogged Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign . Ellison had endorsements from Vermont Sen . Bernie Sanders who challenged Clinton for the Democratic nomination and also from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . Priebus asked McCabe what could be done to push back saying the White House was getting crushed on the story . McCabe demurred and then later called back to say We'd love to help but we can't get into the position of making statements on every story . After President Nixon's scandals in the early 1970s the Carter Administration imposed rules designed to prevent the FBI from meddling in politics and to keep politicians from meddling in criminal investigations . In Bill Clintons first term Attorney General Janet Reno limited contacts between the White House and law enforcement regarding criminal investigations to the top three officials at the Justice Department on the one hand and the President Vice President and the top two White House lawyers on the other . George W . Bush loosened those limits after 9/11 but after a series of scandals his last Attorney General Michael Mukasey reimposed them . Those limits were again adopted by the Obama Administration in a 2009 memo by then-Attorney General Eric Holder . Matt Miller a Holder aide says [[Q-4]] say that Compromising information concerning domestic officials or political organizations or information concerning activities of United States persons intended to affect the political process in the United States may be disseminated to the White House only with the approval of the Attorney General based on a determination that such dissemination is needed for foreign intelligence purposes for the purpose of protecting against international terrorism or other threats to the national security or for the conduct of foreign affairs . Neither the Justice Department nor the FBI would comment on whether the Attorney General approved the contacts between the FBIs leaders and the White House . White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Feb . 24 that there was a carve-out for public affairs communications . The Holder memo does exempt officials in the communications public affairs or press offices of the White House and the Department of Justice from communicating with each other to coordinate efforts . The DOJ's Inspector General Michael Horowitz has already launched a broad investigation of the FBI and the Justice Departments actions during the 2016 election . That investigation includes Comeys handling the FBI probe of Hillary Clintons emails and the meeting held between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton during that investigation in July Horowitz told Congress on Feb . 1 . Returning from a Black History Month event in Jamaica Muhammad Ali Jr . and his mother Khalilah Camacho Ali were pulled aside and separated from each other while going through the immigration checkpoint on Feb . 7 at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport said Chris Mancini a family friend and attorney . Camacho Ali was released a short time later after showing a photo of herself with her ex-husband the former heavyweight boxing champion Mancini said . But Ali Jr . was not carrying a photo of his world-famous father a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom . Ali Jr . 44 who confirmed his Muslim faith was detained about two hours despite telling officials that he's Ali's son and a native-born U . S . citizen Mancini said . It was the first time Ali Jr . and his mother have ever been asked if they're Muslim when re-entering the United States he said . [[Q-5]] Mancini said in a phone interview . [[Q-6]]Reached for comment Friday a U . S . Customs and Border Protection spokesman said in an email: [[Q-7]] according to The Courier-Journal's report about the detention . Ali the three-time heavyweight champion and humanitarian died last June at age 74 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease . People lined the streets of Louisville Kentucky to say goodbye to the city's most celebrated son before a star-studded memorial service watched worldwide . Derogatory information is a broad category that can include anything from terror connections to passport irregularities . Asked for comment a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security Gillian Christensen said [[Q-8]] documentary has been nominated for Best Documentary Short . If the film wins the Oscar the award would go to director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara . Khateeb is one of three people credited for cinematography; Franklin Dow is the film's director of photography . The film focuses on the rescue workers who risk their lives to save Syrians affected by civil war . Many of the group's members have been killed by Syrian President Bashar Assad's air forces . The group also was nominated for last year's Nobel Peace Prize . [[Q-9]] includes emblematic scenes of the deadly 6-year-old conflict: people digging through destroyed homes looking for survivors at constant risk of [[Q-10]] attacks that target first responders after they've arrived at the scene of a strike . Khateeb had been issued a visa to attend the ceremony with Hollywood's biggest stars . But Turkish authorities detained him this week according to the internal U . S . government correspondence and he suddenly needed a passport waiver from the United States to enter the country . now 13 used to heavily rely on her Goldendoodle named Wonder to balance open doors and turn off lights some of the daily tasks she struggled with because she has a severe form of cerebral palsy which affects her legs arms and body . But in 2009 when Ehlena was 5 the girl's school district said her hypoallergenic and certified service dog was not allowed . While the school district slightly bowed to pressures from the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan which advocated on her behalf the civil rights group said Wonder was still prohibited from being by Ehlenas side for most of the day . It was devastating as a parent to see a child go through that Ehlena's mother Stacy Fry told TIME on Thursday . At school where it was really most important for her to be accepted which was key to her development they essentially said no . Nobody deserves to be treated this way . Ehlenas family made the decision to homeschool her choosing not to separate her from Wonder and then filed a federal complaint against the Napoleon School District and the Jackson County Intermediate School District . A fter several legal back and forths the case landed before the Supreme Court . The nations highest court sided with Ehlena in a Its our hope that this will set the precedent thats needed to tear down the barriers Stacy Fry said . We feel that this really is a victory for our family and all the families with children of differing abilities . For us it really means that we did the right thing . It was not in vain . We had a bigger purpose . Neither school district returned requests for comment . Stacy Fry said Ehlena no longer needs the help of Wonder 9 who is retired from his service and spends his days as the girls companion . The girl's mother credits Wonder with teaching her daughter everything she needs to complete tasks on her own . Hes a companion . Hes her sidekick . Hes that constant reassurance she said . Hes given her the confidence to navigate her environment more independently . Socially and emotionally he has given her so much confidence to do the things that she wasnt previously able to do . He was that bridge . Reporters for CNN Politico the New York Times and other outlets were barred from entry to an off-camera but usually on-the-record briefing called a gaggle in Spicer's office . The daily briefing is normally open to all credentialed reporters when the President is not traveling whether the event happens on-camera in the White House Briefing Room or off-camera elsewhere . The White House Correspondents' Association a group that represents credentialed reporters promptly denounced the move . [[Q-11]] said board president Jeff Mason of Reuters . [[Q-12]] was not a news organization because of opinions often aired by the network that were sharply critical of Obama's policies . At one point that same year the Treasury Department declined to invite Fox News but not other networks to a briefing prompting complaints from other news organizations . The Obama White House later said the omission of Fox had been made for logistical reasons and included a Fox reporter in a briefing with the same Treasury official . [[Q-13]] said White House spokesman Josh Earnest In recent weeks Trump has made more pointed attacks on news organizations he says have been unfair to him . [[Q-14]] he said Friday in an address to the dated Feb . 9 reported that nine current and former officials had spoken to the newspaper for a report disclosing that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had been misleading about the content of his conversations with Russian officials after the November election . found that 48% of respondents reported a favorable view of the law with 42% reporting an unfavorable view . The poll found the largest shift towards favorability among independents of whom 50% now have a positive view of the law . Kaiser says this is the most popular Obamacare has been in more than 60 of their surveys since 2010 . The survey found people in the U . S . are equally divided however on whether they want the government to repeal or replace the law . Forty-seven percent of respondents said they wanted a repeal; 48% said lawmakers should not vote to repeal it . Of those who do want repeal a higher share said they wanted Congress to wait to repeal the law until a replacement plan is put forth . An al-Qaida-linked insurgent coalition known as the Levant Liberation Committee claimed responsibility for the attacks which also left another high-ranking officer seriously wounded . In a statement on their Telegram channel the group said five attackers stormed the two different security offices . The group said bombs were also detonated at checkpoints outside the buildings just as rescuers were arriving leading to more casualties . The governor of Homs Province Talal Barzani told The Associated Press there were three blasts in total killing more than 32 people . He said the attackers were wearing suicide belts which they detonated in the security offices . The two agencies are two kilometers 1 . 2 miles apart . According to Ikhbariya at least six assailants attacked the two security compounds in Homs' al-Ghouta and al-Mahata neighborhoods clashing with security officers before at least two of them detonated explosive vests killing 32 people . It was not clear if there are any civilians among the casualties . The attacks are among the most spectacular perpetrated against security agencies in the six-year old conflict a coordinated operation against two heavily secured government buildings using a combination of armed assault and suicide bombing . In early days of the conflict bombings targeting state security institutions were frequent usually against military intelligence branches in Damascus and other cities . One of the most dramatic attacks came in July 2012 when insurgents detonated explosives inside a high-level crisis meeting in Damascus killing four top regime officials including the brother-in-law of President Bashar Assad and the then-defense minister . The Syrian security forces run a vast intelligence network that enjoys great powers and operates independently of the military and with little judicial oversight . Rights groups and Syria monitors hold the various branches responsible for some of the more shadowy crimes committed during the conflict including mass arrests torture extrajudicial killings and firing on protesters . In a February report the human rights watchdog Amnesty International reported that between 5000 and 13000 people were killed in mass hangings in the military's Saydnaya prison in Damascus between 2011 and 2015 . It said the detainees were sent to the prison from around the country by the state's four main security branches including the Military Intelligence .
