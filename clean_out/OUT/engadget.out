The hardware hasn't changed since the phone broke cover at CES but we now know what makes it tick . Inside is one of Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 625 chipsets with an Adreno 506 GPU 3GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in storage . Thankfully you can toss in a microSD card as large as 2TB just to be safe . While that's certainly not the fastest slab of silicon out there BlackBerry Mobile says it chose the processor [[Q-1]] to work in tandem with the 3505mAh battery to deliver battery life that can stretch into two full days -- another classic BlackBerry trait the KEYone tries to channel . onboard navigating through menus and frenzied multitasking were no problem -- just what you'd want in a device meant specifically to get things done . Up front is that 4 . 5-inch display running at a slightly odd 3:2 aspect ratio . Everything on that 1620x1080 screen is plenty crisp though it certainly takes a little getting used to . To hear the company's pitchmen tell it the KEYone was purpose-built for people who appreciated the things that made old-school BlackBerrys so great . It stands to reason that the people involved agonized over the keyboard and they've done a great job: I've used every BlackBerry with a physical QWERTY since the BB10 days and I'm pretty pleased with how the keys depress and spring back into place . It'll take a lot of re-training to get my chubby thumbs weaned off a glass touchscreen but even a few moments with the KEYone made me feel like I was up to the challenge . Even better you can slide your fingers across the keyboard to swipe between home-screens and down webpages . Every key also doubles a shortcut for an app or action -- think holding down the L button to launch Lyft -- and I'm seriously thinking of buying a KEYone just for that . . Now we're getting to that other thing BlackBerry has pushed for decades . The main draw beyond the keyboard natch is the hardened kernel BlackBerry has worked to bake into Android itself -- spokespeople eagerly call it the most secure Android device in the world and apps like DTEK should help even lay-people figure out how to make their phones a little safer . Then there's the other stuff needed to play in the big leagues . BlackBerrys have never been great at cameras but they went surprisingly big with the KEYone . Tucked away in the phone's back is one of Sony's 12-megapixel IMX378 camera sensors like the one seen in . I didn't get much time to play with the camera in bright daylight but the photos I did shoot were fairly detailed and well colored even in low light . The Pixels use a lot of really impressive machine learning to make photos taken with their cameras really pop so don't expect the KEYone to steal Google's imaging crown . Even though the software driving it still needs some fine-tuning the KEYone's camera seems leagues ahead of those used in other BlackBerrys . and you probably remember how that went . Quick reminder: it was mostly just OK . This new-found focus is both refreshing and intelligent . BlackBerry Mobile openly admits the KEYone is a total niche phone but considers it an important part of the growing BlackBerry portfolio . Building a strong foundation of phones is how BlackBerry and TCL plan to turn things around and at least some of the carriers that The KEYone is set to launch in multiple markets in April and we're hearing that the US is lower on the list than other places . Fair enough . Even so the company confirmed that in addition to being sold unlocked for $549 carriers will almost certainly offer the KEYone too . That's good news for you -- you can pay for one by the month -- and even better for BlackBerry . Carrier deals mean more visibility and they could definitely use it . As I've said we'll hold off on passing judgment until we get to play with some final hardware but I feel something for BlackBerry now the company hasn't given in me years: cautious excitement . Imagine screaming through deep space swerving through the wreckage of exploding starships in a high-octane scene plucked straight out of a science fiction movie . Suddenly the universe stops frozen in time as your body continues to hurl through the void at high speed . Your stomach churns at the realization that it's moving but somehow the world around you isn't . That's what happened to me this weekend on and my personal love of VR I was looking forward to a smooth ride . My optimism disintegrated when my VR headset froze during one of the ride's first twists . Twice the view in my Gear VR headset halted for more than a second leaping forward to [[Q-2]] with the speeding ride vehicle and creating a gap between what my eyes were seeing and the g-forces my body was experiencing . It was nauseating . If everything had gone as intended I probably would have come away thrilled by a high-speed VR space combat experience that perfectly synced with the roller coaster's track . Instead I was fighting a headache brought on by simulator sickness . This isn't the typical riding experience but it's not unprecedented . Park officials told me that most guests are treated to a smooth virtual reality adventure but certain seats on the ride vehicle have a higher chance of losing synchronization with the track . It's a Six Flags' representative told me it was enough of a problem that one of the park's earlier VR roller coasters barred users from using Gear VR headsets in the front row and the transmitter has since been moved to a location that minimizes the issue . Minimizes yes but doesn't eliminate . Perhaps I'm being too harsh . When the virtual reality space battle wasn't frozen it was breathtaking . It started off by showing me the real world through the Gear VR's passthrough camera before drawing the roller coaster through an augmented reality wormhole to deep space . There I was more than a passenger; I was a participant playing a fast-paced action game that tasked me with shooting down alien fighter pilots while being rocketed through the chaos of a massive space battle . I walked away intrigued by the experience but I was still nauseated . Enough so that every time I thought about riding Galactic Attack again I felt sick . If you ride Six Flags Discovery Kingdom's Galactic Attack VR roller coaster you probably won't have the broken frozen VR experience I endured . Park staff told me it happens only on a few seats at the front of the car and even then only rarely . Six Flags maintenance supervisor Charles Laureano claims that most riders don't get sick at all . [[Q-3]] he said in a statement . [[Q-4]] Indeed park staff told me that sitting in the middle and rear seats will offer a more consistent experience but a potentially nauseating ride shouldn't even be an option -- not even if the chances of failure are low . Theme parks have always been centers of innovation and virtual reality has the potential to be the next big revolution in ride technology -- but harnessing that potential means accepting responsibility for it . Right now Six Flags has a VR roller coaster system that sees failure as inevitable . The fact that my broken stomach-churning VR experience was a known but acceptable issue is frankly unacceptable . I'm lucky to have a high-end VR headset at home but many people will experience virtual reality for the first time on a roller coaster . They deserve to have that first foray into a digital realm be safe exhilarating and free from and as always it's far from perfect . For the most loyal Nintendo fans these imperfections can evoke one of two responses: anger that the company has failed to live up to their expectations or denial that the company is doing anything wrong at all . That's no way to live . Instead let's skip the first four stages of grief and embrace the Nintendo Switch's faults with acceptance . This is everything the Nintendo Switch is doing wrong at launch so far . served as ambassadors to the new consoles using games as a medium to teach new owners everything they needed to know about their hardware . These were fun contained experiences that added value to every console sold . The Nintendo Switch has nothing like that . According to early previews leaks and reports all a new Switch owner can do If you're planning to buy most of your games digitally you'd better invest in a microSD card . The Nintendo Switch comes with just 32GB of internal storage and 6 . 1GB of that is reserved for the console's operating system . That leaves just 25 . 9GB of space for games . That's enough to download a couple of the game's launch titles including have an audio jack but using it from the couch in TV mode would require a very long headphone cable . Nintendo has stated that a companion smartphone app will allow players to access voice chat from a personal device which could open the door for game and chat audio to be piped over your phone's Bluetooth or audio jack but that's a potentially complicated solution to an otherwise straightforward problem . The Nintendo Switch is primarily controlled by two detachable wireless controllers called Joy-cons and the system comes with a handy controller grip to lock them into for comfortable couch play . That's awesome ! Unfortunately it's impossible to charge the Switch's controllers while using them . The only way to charge the controllers out of the box is to attach them directly to the Switch tablet making it impossible to play games in TV mode if the batteries are dead . Nintendo will sell a separate nearly identical controller grip that will charge the Joy-Cons while you play but it costs an extra $30 . The Nintendo Switch is going to hit stores with a ton of flaws -- the growing pains of a new console's first year . It will take time for Nintendo to iron out the machine's flaws with software updates and longer still for the Switch's game library to fill out with enough titles to justify the investment for early adopters . And that's OK . Most of us are fans of products brands and franchises in The first quest you're tasked with involves finding Shrines a kind of mini-dungeon to retrieve some items within . Rather than giving you a waypoint you're told to discover these structures by heading to a good vantage point and surveying the land . Only a couple of these were easy to find -- the others required some exploration and problem solving . I expected the journey to these buildings to be fairly simple . It wasn't . The path to each took me past numerous groups of enemies some of which were easy to deal with and others that totally wiped me out even one-hit-killing me on some occasions . You can't really approach any encounter head-on . You need to use stealth and powers granted to you as you progress to have a chance of succeeding . You'll occasionally come across an enemy that you simply don't have the right equipment to defeat and need to find a path around them . The game also uses its environment to guide you . Several times I came across obstacles I couldn't get past whether they be weather conditions or giant rivers . Each time I looked around hoping to see a building or something of interest to explore . And each time my exploration uncovered an item or a skill that allowed me to progress . is an extension of that philosophy . But as I stood atop a mountain in the game's first area scanning the horizon I saw my future unfolding . Rich canyons lands covered in shadow dense forests volcanoes rivers lakes -- a whole world laid before me and a sense that everything I could see I would one day visit . That feeling of impending adventure was so memorable in Skyrim and it's got me truly excited to throw myself into this game . and other games are easier to draw . There's a big focus on food . Ingredients are everywhere and you can combine them in various ways to create cooked meals that will not only heal you but also increase your stamina or make you impervious to extreme temperatures . This mechanic feels totally at place in This is a truly beautiful game but with less than a week to go till launch it still has problems . First the good: Load times are very fast . From the Switch's home screen to the main menu is almost instant while loading up your save typically takes less than 10 seconds . Certain areas like Shrines require a couple of seconds to load in but typically the experience is a breath of fresh air compared to hard-drive or disc-based gaming . It's worth noting that I'm playing to give firm figures but after playing for a few hours it seems there's a near-perfect 30 frames-per-second lock . Plugged into my TV things weren't quite as smooth . The vast majority of gameplay was at 30FPS but I definitely noticed some frames dropping in forested areas and a couple of times during busy combat . It's no deal-breaker -- I'd go so far as to say this is even fairly common for modern console titles -- but Nintendo is a company almost unrivalled in polish and the drops surprised me . Of course there's a chance we'll get a patch to paper over these issues before long . This doesn't have much to do with the game but if you were looking forward to sharing beautiful images of your gameplay anytime soon curb your enthusiasm . The Switch's built-in screenshot tool outputs full-resolution images 1080p when you're docked 720p in tablet mode but for some reason they just suck . They're being saved as very lossy JPGs typically weighing in at between 150KB and 300KB making them soft and generally nowhere near as pretty as the game itself .
