But in terms of the threat thats represented I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning with a view to indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour in metropolitan areas represents an enormous on-going risk that none of us can ignore . So I think that there is undoubtedly significant ongoing risk which is at least as great as the threat to London in the Seventies when the IRA were activeon the mainland . At the time Britain was facing a concerted terrorist campaign from Irish republicans that saw pubs train stations and Parliament repeatedly targeted in bomb attacks . Of course the imminent fall of Mosul and perhaps the prospective retaking of Raqqa are both bound to lead to a higher instance of returning fighters . Does that mean that the British public need to be immediately alarmed at a spike in terrorist activity within this country ? And the absurdity of much of what happened was more than countered by the excitement it generated: what this did have was meaty acting breathless tension gripping action and some very satisfying storytelling . Frankly after almost 8 hours it was the least we deserved . elaney one of Stranges boys who had the shadow of death on them then secured a ship for his silence but not before further ominous references to past misdeeds:I witnessed and partipicated in darkness that you cannot conceive . Even Strange seemed a bit put out that Delaney wasnt prepared to have a pop at him . Delaney then poisoned himself presumably to buy a little timeand safe in the knowledge that his captors still needed him alive . His life duly saved Delaney than informed Coop just about at his wits end that treason charges would be dropped witnesses would vanish and testimonies would burn because the ravens told me . vents in Taboo generally have to be taken with a few barrels of salt but if you werent suspending your disbelief by this point then you really shouldnt have still been watching . Accordingly at this point I finally threw my hands up in the air and surrendered to the lunacy of the enterprise . And thank goodness I did because what followed was an absolute riot . In the meantime young Robert continued to do his fathers bidding maybe it was easy access to those diamonds that kept him loyal informing all the key players of Delaneys grand plan . Helga and co were kidnapped by the Company Lorna met with spymistress Carlsbad to allow her to cast her eye over the gunpowder and mentions Delaneys intention to sort out the leaky ship . y which it transpired she meant Dumbarton outed as a Company spy and the only man with steadier nerves than Delaney . His who blinks first approach eventually got him disembowelled when he informed Delaney that a letter of safe passage would only be forthcoming in exchange for the Company obtaining rights to Nootka . Michael Kelly so good as Stamper in House of Cards has been one of the unsung heroes of Taboo an appealingly shifty enigma whose loyalties you could never be sure of until his final moments . Heavily outnumbered and outgunned against the kings men carnage was inevitable: Helga died other nameless subordinates fell Lorna was shot and Cholmondeley blown up although both may live to fight another day . The royal regiments were decimated . And through it all strode Delaney impervious to fear pain humility and frankly the vast majority of recognisable human emotions and feelings . It was thrillingly mounted and utterly involving . he survivors made it to the ship just . For a time it looked like all the major figures would remain in play with just their lieutenants sacrificed . Then Strange went up in smoke at the end Winters revenge perhaps ? Jonathan Pryce and his angry stick will be missed . Fingers crossed Cholmondeley survives his potential fatal injuries as long as his mouth and manhood are in working order I think we can assume hell continue uncowed . First stop however will be the Azores and a man called Colonnade to whom they're sailing under American colours . Might they then set up camp in a perhaps even the ? new world ? As dankly evocative as this Regency London was I shant be sorry to see a little sunlight pierce these stories . If the creators are courageous theyll cut the second series down to six episodes and give Jessie Buckley her head allowing Lorna to truly establish herself as Delaneys equal . At the very least after a triumphant home stretch the prospect of another go-round is a truly enticing one and I wouldnt have said that a few weeks ago . The reason is simple . Even if England win with bonus points against Italy and Scotland they would still only be a maximum of four points ahead of Ireland heading into that mouthwatering final game in Dublin on March 18 . Destiny is in Irelands hands . That is their prerogative . Irelands fans are certainly dreaming of that grandstand finish against England however . The manner in which their team came back on Saturdayto subdue a dangerous France side who had made an electric start at the Aviva Stadium eventually prevailing with their biggest winning margin over France in the Six Nations since 1975 had them in raptures . s did the return of one Jonathan Sexton . The big talking point before the game had revolved around Schmidts decision to bring the Leinster fly half straight back into his team after five weeks out with a calf injury . In previous years such a decision would not have merited a second thought; Sexton being having proved himself one of the finest No 10s in the world a department in which Ireland hardly boast the greatest of depth . Such has been Paddy Jacksons development however and the litany of injuries suffered by Sexton in recent seasons that there were some wondering whether this tournament might herald a changing of the guard . At 31 Sexton still has a few years left in him but can his body still withstand the rigours of Test match rugby ? On this evidence Ireland will hope so . Sexton got off to a mixed start . One early carry and a decent Garryowen were the high points . But he also sent one kick straight into touch under no pressure at all looking heavenwards in exasperation . While he was finding his feet Ireland as a whole were looking sloppy regularly getting turned over in the opening 20 minutes . his France team offer so much more dynamism and verve than recent vintages . The likes of Gal Fickou who exchanged passes with No8 Louis Picamoles out on the left wing in the early stages and scrum-half Baptiste Serin are a joy to watch . Serin sold Jamie Heaslip an outrageous dummy and wriggled clear before stepping Rob Kearney to win France an early penalty in front of the posts . France then thought they had scored Fickou flicking a loose ball up into the path of his centre partner Rmi Lamerat who went over on an arcing run . Replays showed Fickou had fractionally knocked on in the process but France went 6-0 up anyway with Nigel Owens going back to an earlier penalty . reland did not so much as put a foot inside the French 22m in the opening quarter . But Schmidts team have mental resilience in abundance and despite their faltering start they managed to wrest back the initiative in the 20 minutes before half time going in 7-6 up after Conor Murray bulldozed his 6ft 2in frame over the line from close range after a clearout from the excellent Ringrose . Ireland could and maybe should have been six points better off at the interval . Captain Rory Best had promised in the build-up that his team would remain committed to the more attacking philosophy they have shown in the last 12 months and he was true to his word . Ireland repeatedly eschewing kickable penalties in favour of kicks for the corner or quick tap penalties . oach Guy Novs would have been delighted with the score at the break . But there were signs as Ireland battered away in the minutes before half- time that Sexton was beginning to hit his straps . Irelands fly-half was finding joy with a midfield loop passing to his centres and then lopping around to collect the ball again . From one such move Sexton streaked clear kicking over the top for Keith Earls to chase . I thought he was really really positive for us Schmidt said of Sextons performance . We varied it up a bit in the second half because we had to try to get them chasing things . I thought he did it superbly a couple of great kicks in behind . And we know he never shirks his defensive responsibilities . he second half continued in the much the same vein . Ireland on the front foot Sexton growing in confidence all the time putting over two penalties and then punching the air in delight after sending a drop goal attempt sailing through the uprights . It was Irelands first successful drop goal since 2011 . Sexton departed to a standing ovation when he was replaced by Jackson with 12 minutes remaining . The other two changes are in the forwards . South African-born Bernard Le Roux will come in at flanker for the injured Loann Goujon and Rabah Slimani - France's try scorer against England - will replace prop Uini Atonio who is out of form and has been benched . The trust itself does not exist until triggered by the death of the second spouse so there is nothing to unwind but the order to establish a trustmust be removed . Beneficiaries of a will have two years from the death of the second parent to disband the trust using a All parties have to agree to this any beneficiaries as well as the trustees often close friends or neighbours chosen by the person who originally wrote the trust into their will .

Some patients were effectively being told that they could not get help until they had starved themselves further they warned . r Agnes Ayton vice chairman of its faculty of eating disorders said: We are seeing waits of up to 16 months for non-urgent referrals . It is really worrying because we know that the more quickly people start receiving treatment the quicker they are to respond to it . onsultant psychiatrist Dr Navjot Bedi who runs an inpatient unit for adults at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester the regional unit for the East Midlands said its waiting times had doubled from four to eight weeks over the last decade .

Winning in Copeland was always going to be difficult: its a marginal seat with a small majority and there were very specific local issues including the future of the nuclear industry which the Tories focused on misleadingly claiming Labour would threaten jobs despite the fact that Jeremy Corbyn spelled out Labours commitment to the industry . The Tories threw everything at Copeland Theresa May unusually made a personal visit and they poured resources into the campaign . Its also true to say that politics is presently in a period of flux following the recent Brexit referendum . Throw into the mix low turnout and this was always going to be challenging but we fought hard standing up against Tory cuts to the NHS . So while wed acknowledge that theres more to do for Labour winning in Stoke-on-Trent shows that we are competitive and that we are standing up to this failing Tory government fighting for our NHS and for building an economy that works for everyone . Losing in Stoke-on-Trent isnt good for the Tories and Theresa May . They threw everything at it and Theresa May visited there too showing that she thought she could win . Many people said the Tories were on track to win both seats and they were briefing that they expected to do well and possibly win both seats . That they havent is a blow for them and the Prime Minister . In many ways the real story is of a terrible night for UKIP . They threw absolutely everything at Stoke-on-Trent: their party leader was their candidate in a seat they said was their best chance of getting a win . This is a decisive rejection of UKIP's claims to represent working class people . The people of Stoke have rejected UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty . Nigel Farage said recently that winning in Stoke-on-Trent was fundamental to the future of UKIP and the fact that they have lost is a hammer blow to them . This campaign has exposed them and Paul Nuttall as a party and leader who want to privatise the NHS and who offer nothing to working people . This was supposed to be the seat where they showed they could be an alternative to Labour but after this result that claim lies in tatters . Police said they did not know have any information on the motives for the attack which comes just over two months after an asylum seeker killed 12 people when he drove a lorry into a crowd in Berlin but said that initial findings suggested it was not terrorism-related . The suspect was identified as a 35-year-old German man .
