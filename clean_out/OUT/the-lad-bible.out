[[Q-1]]He sent the messages in the early hours of February 13 and talks of a [[Q-2]] among others . He was reported missing four days later after not returning to his hotel at nearby island Koh Samui and the police have since found and identified his body . 2015s top searches found 'lesbian' come out on top pun kind of intended with 'teen' in second . 'Step mom' was still popular then coming in at number three showing there's still as strong market for those more mature while cartoon yes cartoon comes fourth with 'MILF' down at five . one theory could be that viewers act out their opposite fantasy - the unobtainable . So those in the 00s who desired a more mature woman now know the reality as their sexual inquisitiveness has been answered and now they go for the new unknown and unobtainable again - part of this is 'younger' women or older women that are actually related - so MILF has been replaced basically by teen and step mum . Only that's part of the faade . People searching know that most 18 year olds in videos are actually anything but and many are in their mid-20s or older . Dressing them up in school clothes may be naughty perhaps even pervy but not necessarily harmful . That's where I stand . I don't believe people really wish to have sex with barely legal teens in school uniforms . Or with their step mums/step sisters . If they do we have a major problem . That said I do think it's odd that 'teen' has come either top or second in the past four years . With such a plethora of choice it's uninspiring that such a basic keyword is the top search . You can search any nationality any orifice anything . Use your imagination ! 'Lesbian' which was the number one search in 2015 makes sense to me . Seeing a massive penis can make you feel inferior in that department and a hairy arsehole isn't the best for viewing pleasure . Straight girls also perhaps enjoy watching lesbian porn with their boyfriend more than a man watching male gay porn while of course lesbian women will also get turned on by lesbian porn . That trend is staying . Most of will probably recognise the Fairtrade symbol . You might even let it influence your purchases; I know that I will choose coffee that has the Fairtrade symbol because even though I don't know much about it I know that basically it's a good thing . In Kenya's coffee and tea-growing regions one in three people live in poverty while tea pickers in Malawi earn less than 1 . 46 a day . This is not enough to provide decent food education or healthcare for their families or invest in better farming; no matter how hard they work they can't work themselves out of poverty until they're given a fair deal - and this is where the Fairtrade Foundation comes in . Fairtrade works in more than 74 developing countries right across the world and because Fairtrade is 50 percent owned by the farmers and workers it helps they are personally involved in making decisions that affect them their communities and other producers farmers and workers . The Fairtrade Foundation was set up in 1992 with the aim of empowering disadvantaged producers in developing countries . The need for the organisation was borne out of the fact that small-scale farmers can quite easily be marginalised and taken advantage of when it comes to trading . By having the backing of an organisation as big Fairtrade they can broker better deals and make sure that they are paid fairly for their work . In 2013-14 Fairtrade paid out 106 . 2 million 89 million in premiums which can go on to totally transform the lives of producers and their communities . Individual producers who are awarded the grants are left to determine what the money is best spent on so this could mean sending children to school building roads and bridges or improving their business . Millions of people are helped via the foundation each year; one of those people is Edson Moatchedwe a 45-year-old tea farmer and father of seven from Malawi . He is also the chairman of the Sukambizi Association Trust SAT where he meets up with other farmers to discuss farming techniques . from Abertay University which found that ethical food tastes better . Dr Boyka Bratanova and her team gave people identical food products to taste and score but were told some of the food was produced ethically and some was not . Those who were told that they were eating ethically produced food rated it higher . super tester Krystina Mason who has worked at the company for six years said: [[Q-3]]It was James Blunt . It was James Blunt trying to get his pop career back . "
