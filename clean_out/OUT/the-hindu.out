A few months after the launch of the National Food Security Act NFSA in the State the public distribution system PDS authorities have quietly begun a give it up drive covering all the essential commodities that are being provided at heavily subsidised rates . . One can open an online account by registering with the website the details such as number of ration card mobile phone and Aadhaar . Aimed at about 1 . 91-crore rice-drawing cards the give it up option covers not only rice sugar toor dhal urad dhal and wheat but also the Pongal gift pack . Meanwhile since November [when the Act came into force] there have been complaints of non-availability or irregular supply of rice even though officials in charge of fair price shops FPS are bound under the NFSA to ensure the provision of five kg of rice per month per person . The policy of the government is supply rice free of cost . A housewife whose card is with a FPS in Kamarajapuram near Tambaram says If you do not visit your shop within the first week you will not get any thing from the ration . Pointing out that there is no such government rule T . Sadagopan president of the Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumers Centre says that if and when rice is available FPS officials would ordinarily give greater quantity of boiled rice than raw rice . A beneficiary attached to FPS in Ram Nagar Velachery says even though his card has four members he is being given only 15 kg rice against his quota of 20 kg as per the law . Besides out of the 15 kg the quantity of raw rice is five kg . There are also complaints that those who have not obtained any commodity have received messages on their mobile phones that billing has been done against their cards . The government early this month issued an order allowing the rice cardholders to get certain amount of wheat free of cost in lieu of rice . This has been done as the allocation of wheat for the State is 1 . 62 lakh tonnes out of the total annual allocation of 36 . 78 lakh tonnes according to the government order . A senior official in the Food Department says the give it up drive has been prepared mainly to address the problem of bogus billing . Following complaints of bogus billing officials of the shops have been strictly warned . Several punishment measures are being contemplated he says adding that people can send complaints of bogus billing to 9980904040 by typing PDS space 107 . The four hospitals at the centre of the probe Girish Noola Surgical & Maternity Hospital Basava Hospital L . M Care Hospital and Sudha Memorial Smruti Maternity & Surgical Nursing Home were probed for alleged violation of various provisions of the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments Act KPME 2007 and Rules 2009 . Based on the inquiry Deputy Commissioner Ujjwal Kumar Ghosh suspended the licences of Noola hospital in November 2016 and the other three hospitals on January 10 2017 for six months . Mr . Ghosh wrote to the Karnataka Medical Council KMC on January 23 2017 recommending disciplinary action against Dr . Girish Noola and Dr . Smita Noola who conducted over 600 hysterectomies in two years in alleged violation of law and professional ethics . The KMC has yet to take a call on this . Pinku Bai married at 13 had three children by 19 and underwent a hysterectomy at 24 because her doctor warned her of serious health complications due to a swollen uterus . Severe abdominal pain and vaginal discharge had prompted her to seek medical help . With the dire warning of the Big C leading to death ringing in her ears she underwent a hysterectomy in November 2014 paying 30000 with money borrowed from relatives . Today wiping away tears Pinku Bai says I agreed to the surgery as I kept thinking what would happen to my children if I were to die ? But the procedure did not end her difficulties . She developed severe backache weakness prolonged tiredness chest pain and partial vision loss . In Arsikere and Kadur taluks Chitradurga Davangere and Tumakuru districts in Chincholi Aland Chittapur and Jevargi taluks of Kalaburagi Yadgir and Raichur districts there are many stories of women approaching gynaecologists with complaints of bleeding nagging abdominal pain or a simple urinary tract infection only to return home without a uterus . Omkaramma 30 of Kolagunda gollarahatti in Hassan had a hysterectomy four years ago after just one consultation . She was ready to do anything to get rid of the excruciating pain . Three other women from the same village were operated upon the same day . One of them died three months later . Lalitha Bais medical examination pointed to a urinary tract infection . Noola Hospital in Kalaburagi told me I would die soon and convinced me to have a hysterectomy . I was operated upon even though we had no money . But I was discharged only after we paid 25000 she recalled . Post-surgery her infection persists and she spends hard-earned money buying drinking water hoping it would help . KJC activists and victims allege that the doctors identified by the probe are continuing with unwarranted hysterectomies . They demand the cancellation of the registration of the doctors and booking of criminal cases against them . They are also demanding suitable compensation for the victims . A survey of 35 tandas habitations done by the KJC claims the ratio of households to hysterectomies is high . In Ambalaga tanda Kalaburagi it was 55 households to 15 hysterectomies; in Ajjanahalli Hassan district it was 40:13; at V . K . Salagar tanda it was 40:25; and in Belamagi tanda 80:25 . On why the health issue has snowballed Roopa Hassan writer and social activist said: Its largely due to unhygienic customs that women are forced to adopt in the gollarahattis . During menstruation they have to stay away from their homes in a shelter which is not clean . Many find hysterectomy a relief from this monthly ordeal . Doctors capitalise on this . Those who performed hysterectomy for flimsy reasons actually violated the sexual and reproductive health rights of women . I have spoken to many women and none had a biopsy or pap smear done before having the uterus removed . Concurring with this R . Venkatesh a gynaecologist and District Health Officer in Hassan says Hysterectomy should be done as the last option when all other medications fail to control abnormal bleeding infection and fibroids and that too after conducting a biopsy pap smear and other examinations . Another inquiry committee constituted by the Karnataka State Commission for Women in September 2015 headed by social activist K . Neela investigated the issue in Kalaburagi district and submitted a 105-page report in April 2016 . We have provided sufficient and solid evidence to prosecute the doctors and hospitals involved . Yet no action has been taken she says . The expert committee constituted by the State Health Department headed by T . R . Sudha found that Dr . Dayanand a government doctor at Biruru Community Health Centre in Chikkamagaluru conducted 1428 unnecessary hysterectomies at a private establishment between 2012 and 2014 . More than 40% of the women who underwent the surgery were below the age of 35 . A CID inquiry is under way even after two years . The only action taken up was the transfer of the doctor from Birur to Davangere . The hospitals in question dismiss the allegations . We never performed unwarranted hysterectomies on innocent people . On the contrary people who were afraid of cancer themselves forced us to conduct the surgery despite our advice against it . We used to give medicines for their ailments and advise them to wait for 3-4 months . When they were persistent we had to perform the surgery Dr . Sambashivarao Managing Director Sudha Memorial Smruti Maternity & Surgical Nursing Home told No hysterectomy was done at his hospital during the past 11 months . After his hospitals registration was cancelled he got a new registration under the name of Sudha Memorial Smruti General & Surgical Nursing Home . I am deeply hurt at being defamed . This is the gift that I am honoured with at the age of 75 for serving the people for 48 years . I wont approach the court . If I am given four months I will just wind up the hospital and leave the city forever he added . The detection of a staggering 58442 smuggled amphibians over five years demonstrates the persistence of the illegal trade despite increasing enforcement reveals the recently-conducted study by researchers from Freeland India and Turtle Survival Alliance . This is just the tip of the iceberg and the actual seizures could be much higher . Since there is no centralised data we started keeping data from 2016 . During this time an additional 30000 live individuals were seized in the country a majority from the Gangetic plains said Shailendra Singh Programme Director of Turtle Survival Alliance and co-author of the study . Within India the Gangetic Plains accounted for 46% of all seizures with Lucknow and Kanpur being major hubs . Researchers said this was linked to tightening of the enforcement including an active Special Task Force in Uttar Pradesh and the Gangetic belt . There is a tradition of turtle poaching in this area given the diversity of TFT population along the river . Apart from the Ganga and its tributaries TFTs have been poached in rivers of the Western Ghats and in smaller numbers in the Eastern Ghats . The cities of Mumbai Chennai and Kolkata have seen large-scale seizures suggesting accumulation before export the researchers said . The species are poached by fishermen in streams ponds and rivers . Very rarely are the traded species bred they are mostly taken from the wild . It reaches middlemen who have strong networks to smuggle them across international borders . Turtles and tortoises are taken in trucks buses and trains towards Bangladesh or through airports to south-east Asia said Uttara Mendiratta who along with colleague Vallari Sheel from Freeland India authored the report . On the persistence of the trade and expanding list of species being poached Ms Mendiratta says In the meat markets in Bangladesh there is indiscriminate poaching now as long as the turtles caught can be consumed . In the pet trade of SE Asia and China there is an increasing diversity of species that is being sold from India . Before it was primarily Star Tortoises . But now the numbers of species such as Spotted Pond Turtle are on the rise . With a rise in the number of trained Belgian Malinois sent to the Red Corridor the CRPF has finalised a protocol to be followed in case one of the canines loses its life in the line of duty . The Belgian Malinois were first introduced in the Red Corridor in 2013 and currently 284 dogs are deployed . Another 45 are under training . After serving the nation for their entire productive life the dog deserves dignified last rites in consonance with a valiant forces traditions . This document is an attempt to prescribe a protocol to bring some level of uniformity in honouring these trusted companions when they finally end their vigilant watch over our lives and freedoms the protocol says . In case the deceased dog had been awarded a medal for operational excellence it would be handed over to the handler who will in turn send it to the Dog Breeding and Training Centre in Taralu Karnataka where it would be displayed in a gallery said the SOP . An 18-gun salute to be performed in a normal regimented fashion . It is both permissible and appropriate at all ceremonies to play Taps a bugle call for a fallen dog . The dogs leash collar and an inverted food bowl signifying the bond with the handler should be placed at the grave . A granite slab measuring 28 X 18 be placed as a memorial stone at the burial site the SOP said . At one end after all the book stalls was a small stall with just a book and a pen on a table and a laptop on another . Visitors were invited to write down their contributions stories poems drawings or articles . The idea was to create a book from the street . The only condition was that the work should be spontaneous . The book draws much from the character of Manaveeyam Street where anyone can come and perform without being judged . So we thought the book should also be open to anyone . We have included most of the contributions that we got from the street . No particular subject was given to the visitors . But there is a running thread of the street spirit that you can see in most of the works says T . D . Kuriyachan who came up with the idea . The book therefore carries everything from a lament for the saplings on the road suffering from climate change to an art sketch of the thoroughfare . There are personal reflections of love loss and pain . There is even a short sarcastic poem on literary circles turning into mutual admiration clubs . Two days after an Indian engineer was murdered and another injured in an apparent case of racial-related violence the White House on Friday rejected the suggestion that the incident may have been caused by the anti-immigration climate created by President Donald Trump . Asked whether the rhetoric that the President or that generally has been out here recently could have contributed in any way to the murder of 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Kansas on Wednesday night White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: I mean obviously any loss of life is tragic but Im not going to get into like that kind of to suggest that theres any correlation I think is a bit absurd . So Im not going to go any further than that . President Donald Trump did not tweet on the Kansas attack even after it was prominently covered across U . S . media platforms even as he responded to gun violence in Chicago the same evening with a tweet: Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago . What is going on there totally out of control . Chicago needs help ! Meanwhile Indian Ambassador to the U . S . Navtej Sarna told an audience that included 27 U . S . State Governors on Friday evening that India was confident that American administrators would take necessary measures to ensure that such incidents were not repeated . In a first-of-its-kind diplomatic initiative Mr . Sarna hosted Governors from both the Republican and Democratic parties which he said was a demonstration of the bipartisan support for India-U . S . bilateral relations . I am sure all right-thinking people in America will work together and ensure that this tragic event is behind us Mr . Sarna said . We cant let hatred win said Indian-American Senator from California Kamala Harris . Senseless acts of violence have no place in our country . Im heartbroken by this tragedy said Pramila Jayapal Democratic Congresswoman from Washington State . She said hate crimes were rising as a result of Trump administrations ideas against immigrants . California Congressman Ro Khanna said: Any act of violence fuelled by hatred and xenophobia and prejudice cannot be tolerated . I have faith in local and federal law enforcement to justly investigate this shooting as a hate crime . Illinois Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi California Republican Brad Sherman and Pennsylvania Republican Scott Perry also condemned the incident . This was an attack not only on the victims but on the sense of security of Indians Indian-Americans and millions of other people of colour across the nation said Mr . Krishnamoorthi . While details continue to emerge if true we expect the governmental authorities to prosecute this act for what it is a hate crime the South Asian Bar Association said in a statement . This incident is the latest in a rising tide of hate violence against South Asian Muslim Sikh Hindu Middle Eastern and Arab communities electrified by the presidents anti-immigrant policies stated Suman Raghunathan executive director of South Asian-Americans Leading Together SAALT a civil rights group . Meanwhile wife of the deceased Srinivas Kuchibhotla said she had discussed the idea of returning to India many times with her husband but said he on an H-1B guest worker visa was keen to remain in America . I need an answer; I need an answer from the government . I need an answer for everyone out there Sunayana Dumala said during a media interaction organised by Garmin the company that employed Kuchibhotla . Not just for my husband . . . but for everyone all those people of any raceI need an answer she said . Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday criticised the Delhi police for their handling of clashes at Delhi Universitys Ramjas college earlier this week and alleged that the force has become an agent for Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and BJP goons . I strongly condemn the manner in which the Delhi police have become an agent of the ABVP and the BJP . It is the duty of the police to protect the people of Delhi and not allow the ABVP and the BJP to engage in goondaism sic he told reporters at a press briefing . Holding Prime Minister Narendra Modi responsible for the manner in which the Delhi police were allowed to behave Mr . Kejriwal said: I hope the PM will perform his duty in an impartial way and not work like a BJP worker . Mr . Modi is not the PM of the BJP only but of all people including me and he should perform his duty Mr . Kejriwal said adding that the Delhi police should be held accountable for the February 22 violence . On Wednesday Ramjas College witnessed clashes between members of the Left-affiliated AISA and the RSS-backed ABVP . The genesis of the clash was an invite to JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid to address a seminar on Culture of Protests which was withdrawn by the college authorities following opposition by the ABVP . The Delhi police have acknowledged unprofessional conduct on the part of some of its personnel during the clash and suspended three policemen . Addressing a well-attended election rally here on Saturday Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to reassure the people of Manipur that there was nothing in the Naga Peace Accord signed by his government with the NSCN-IM in 2015 that would go against the interests of the State . This accord happened a year-and-a-half back . I told Congress leaders what was in it . And today they are dividing Manipuri people . Will you accept the lies of the 15-year corrupt Congress regime or the truth of the Prime Minister who has served you honestly for two-and-a-half years Mr . Modi asked the crowd . Hiting out at the Ibobi Singh government for failing to maintain the supply of essential services following the economic blockade of the State by Naga students Mr . Modi said Is it not the State government's duty to maintain supply of essential commodities ? As per the Constitution this is the responsibility of the Manipur government and the police . What kind of government is it under which there is a blockade and children do not even get milk ? Here is a thought experiment . Say the powers that be who govern India have decided that we the people are in need of a new national anthem . More importantly you the reader of this page have been asked to write the words . The conditions proposed are simple but open-ended: the words must be jargon- and euphemism-free the lines must arouse a feeling of the collective but also be spacious enough for our private imaginations to wander and ultimately the words must neither coerce identities nor elevate one group of people over another . And yes it must be short . This now when you think about it is a mighty difficult task: to write words that can soar and yet remain grounded . More than the melody and gravitas the real challenge is to speak to a diversity in a country without being treacly and melodramatic . In essence while acts of patriotism are probably easier to identify finding the right kind of language to describe patriotism is hard . Conversely harder still is knowing what exactly is this patriotism that our language seeks to describe ? Even Rabindranath Tagore who was ever suspicious of false gods and whose lines are now deemed as part of our sacred obligation by the Supreme Court no less was suspicious of patriotism from above . In his now little-read collection of essays on nationalism Tagore writes that neither the colourless vagueness of cosmopolitanism nor the fierce self-idolatory of nation-worship is the goal of human history . Man he thought is not born to worship his nation far less offer an uncritical fealty to the symbols that exalt the idea of that nationhood . Yet one of the great mysteries of our lives in the 21st century is how the idea of a nation or of a bureaucratic state becomes the carapace inside which our adult emotional lives are spent . Most of us cant imagine our lives without a nationality to anchor ourselves to . Man may not be an island but he is an islet in an archipelago of affiliations connected yet separate . Even refugees who sometimes save themselves at the expense of their peers insist on a membership in the very same collective that now lies in fragments . Patriotism or a form of commitment to the nation in essence howsoever disfigured its patrimonial legacies have often been is here to stay . These questions of patriotism burble up yet again now because the Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi has deemed that a debate on mandatory anthem singing in schools is necessary . Further he proposes to review and perhaps re-litigate the 30-year-old exception from singing the anthem granted to the adherents of Jehovahs Witnesses . This plan is in spite of an overburdened judicial system ostensibly because according to Mr . Rohatgi it is extremely important to instil a sense of nationalism from childhood . For an officer of the state a post-colonial state no less surrounded by inimical neighbours and marked by inflexible citizens citing transcendental claims it is understandable that sacralising the nation seems natural even attractive . But this attitude forgets that nations dont grow fonder in our hearts far less elicit sacrifices or foster cohesion from citizens because of state-mandated daily ounces of patriotism in our schools . On the contrary what we see world over is that strong states are marked by norms of collegiality and traditions of respect and dissent towards symbols of our collective union not legally enforceable mandates with the threat of punishment . Dismissing a West Virginia state law that previously demanded Jehovahs Witnesses recite the Pledge of Allegiance Justice Robert Jackson of the U . S . Supreme Court wrote in 1943 that to believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds . This is something our democratic government must also remember . Worse yet coercing the singing of the national anthem a song of our collective freedoms a testimony to the affirmations of gratitude and joy by our ancestors will paradoxically be associated by our children with an unfreedom no different than the tedium of multiplication tables and the tyranny of eating vegetables . We dont after all legally mandate either of those two . Spot fixing is back in the news . Three players in the Pakistan Super League have been suspended others questioned . There is an uncomfortable feeling that it never went away but merely got more sophisticated with the offenders staying one step ahead of the detectors . For India what is worrying is not that anybody has been caught recently but that even if one had been there is no law yet to deal with such cases . When the law is no deterrent temptations are more attractive and risk-takers are more willing to play or not for a few dollars more . You cannot of course legislate against human greed but you can make it less profitable to give in to it . Match-fixing wasnt a crime in India and players caught had to be tried under the provisions of cheating . It was important said commentators experts Parliamentarians law enforcement authorities to pass a law dealing specifically with fixing in sport . To try Sreesanth under the dreaded MCOCA Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act was both desperate and futile . He was naturally cleared under that law and equally naturally went about saying he had been cleared of spot fixing . You cannot be guilty of a crime that does not exist in the system . Earlier in 2012 Mohammad Azharuddin was cleared by the Andhra Pradesh High Court . But the court had merely said that the BCCI ban was unfair not that the player was innocent of match-fixing something he had confessed to according to the CBI report . Every time such a scandal erupts there is much breast-beating . Why dont we have a law ? Why cant offenders be jailed ? How can we allow this desecration of the sanctity of sport ? Editorials are written experts go on television panels asking these and other questions . Meanwhile the Prevention of Sporting Fraud Bill 2013 which had fixed jail terms and fines for match fixing has already dropped out of the public consciousness . The current government which had pushed for its passage when it was in the opposition seems to have abandoned it . The 2013 Bill proposed to create sporting fraud as a special category of offence which included the manipulation of result deliberate under-performance disclosure of inside information and failure to report an offence . The average follower of sports might welcome these steps to criminalise match-fixing . In 2015 the Bill went to the Cabinet for consideration . And that was that . There have been attempts to move sports from the State list to the concurrent list a move that was hailed in 1988 when it was first proposed . That bill however was withdrawn in 2009 . Last year the Sports Minister garnered the support of the national sports federations and later the sports ministers in the States and we may be closer to such a shift than at any time in the recent past .
