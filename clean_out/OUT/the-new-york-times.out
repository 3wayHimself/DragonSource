In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference Mr . Trump criticized as fake news organizations that publish anonymously sourced reports that reflect poorly on him . And in a series of Twitter posts he assailed the F . B . I . as a dangerously porous agency condemning unauthorized revelations of classified information from within its ranks and calling for an immediate hunt for leakers . Hours after the speech as if to demonstrate Mr . Trumps determination to punish reporters whose coverage he dislikes Sean Spicer the White House press secretary barred journalists from The New York Times and several other news organizations from attending his daily briefing a highly unusual breach of relations between the White House and its press corps . The moves underscored the degree to which Mr . Trump and members of his inner circle are eager to use the prerogatives of the presidency to undercut those who scrutinize him dismissing negative stories as lies and confining press access at the White House to a few chosen news organizations considered friendly . The Trump White House has also vowed new efforts to punish leakers . by CNN on Thursday night that a White House official had asked the F . B . I . to rebut a New York Times article last week detailing contacts between Mr . Trumps associates and Russian intelligence officials . The report asserted that a senior White House official had called top leaders at the F . B . I . to request that they contact reporters to dispute the Timess account . The fake news doesnt tell the truth Mr . Trump said to the delight of the conservatives packed into the main ballroom at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center just south of Washington . It doesnt represent the people it doesnt and never will represent the people and were going to do something about it . In the West Wing less than three hours later the consequences were becoming clear . Mr . Spicer told a handpicked group of reporters in a briefing in his spacious office that the White House would relentlessly counter coverage it considered inaccurate . Were going to aggressively push back he said according to a recording of the session provided by a reporter who was allowed to attend . Were just not going to sit back and let you know false narratives false stories inaccurate facts get out there . Reporters from The Times BuzzFeed News CNN The Los Angeles Times Politico the BBC and The Huffington Post were among those shut out of the briefing . Aides to Mr . Spicer admitted only reporters from a group of news organizations that the White House said had been previously confirmed . Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties Dean Baquet the executive editor of The Times said in a statement . We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations . Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest . We invited the pool so everyone was represented Sarah Huckabee Sanders the deputy White House press secretary said in an email Friday afternoon referring to the small group of reporters on hand at the White House each day to follow the president and send reports to the broader press corps . We decided to add a couple of additional people beyond the pool . Nothing more than that . The White House Correspondents Association which represents the press corps also protested the decision . But Jeff Mason the organizations president pointed out that the White House had provided near-daily briefings and accepted questions from a variety of news outlets since Mr . Trump took office . Were not happy with how things went today Mr . Mason said in an interview . But its important to keep in mind the context of how things have gone up until now . He added: I dont think that people should rush to judgment to suggest that this is the start of a big crackdown on media access . It is not the job of political leaders to determine how journalists should conduct their work and sets a terrible example for the rest of the world said the groups executive director Joel Simon . The U . S . should be promoting press freedom and access to information . Those comments came shortly after his own aides had held a briefing for the White House press pool on the condition of anonymity to deny CNNs story suggesting there had been improper contact between the White House and the F . B . I . regarding the Times article on Russian contacts . Later in the briefing from which the Times was excluded Mr . Spicer said that it was top F . B . I . officials first Andrew G . McCabe the deputy director and later James B . Comey the director who approached Reince Priebus the White House chief of staff the day after the article appeared to say that it was false . The F . B . I . on Friday declined to provide its account of those conversations . On Thursday night an F . B . I . official said that the White House had asked last week for the bureaus help disputing the article and that senior F . B . I . officials had rejected the request citing the investigation into Russian efforts to affect the election . s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election . The intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr . Trump was Mr . Spicers small-group Friday session known as a gaggle was scheduled as an off-camera event less formal than his usual briefings that are carried live on cable news . But past administrations have not selected outlets that can attend such sessions . Tensions always emerge between an administration and the reporters who cover it and it is not unusual for a White House to single out groups of journalists for special briefings outside of the daily on-camera question-and-answer session . The Obama White House was harshly criticized by members of the press corps after it tried to exclude Fox News from interviews with top administration officials . The attack which the federal and local authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime reverberated far beyond both states . It raised new alarms about a climate of hostility toward foreigners in the United States where President Trump has made clamping down on immigration a central plank of his America first agenda . The White House strongly rejected the notion that there might be any connection between the shooting and the new administrations sharp language about immigration . In a brief phone interview on Friday night Mr . Madasani described the remarks made Wednesday by the man sitting near him and Mr . Kuchibhotla at the restaurant . He asked us what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally Mr . Madasani said . Both men were educated in the United States and were working here legally . The shots echoed around the area and Chris Lacross soon emerged from a store a few doors down to an unimaginable scene: an emergency medical technician performing CPR on a man lying in the doorway of the bars front patio where tables and chairs had been flipped over and someone was shouting that they needed towels . He was talking to her Im on the run; Im hiding out from the law so she stuck around Captain Lynch said of the bartender . She just hung out there talking to the guy until he said I shot those guys and thats why Im hiding out from the police . Mr . Purinton spent time in the Navy and according to a website where veterans can list their military records was deployed aboard the Long Beach a missile cruiser from 1988 to 1990 . He later worked for the Federal Aviation Administration but left the agency in 2000 a spokeswoman said . The dead man Mr . Kuchibhotla worked for Garmin a GPS navigation and communications device company . One of the wounded men Mr . Madasani like Mr . Kuchibhotla in his early 30s also worked for Garmin according to the Indian government . On Friday counselors were at the companys campus in Olathe a hub of South Asian immigrants where 84 languages are spoken in the local school district . Mr . Madasanis father Jagan Mohan Reddy a government engineer in Hyderabad India said his family was in shock . He said he did not know whether he would ask Mr . Madasani who received a graduate degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and another son living in the United States to leave the country . On Friday Mr . Kuchibhotlas killing and the wounding of Mr . Madasani led to a chorus of fury in India where the attack dominated the news media to such an extent that the top American diplomat in the country was compelled to issue a statement condemning what she described as a tragic and senseless act . The Justice Department is under pressure to bring federal charges in the case . Moussa Elbayoumy the board chairman for the Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the government should consider filing hate crime charges in order to send a strong message that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be tolerated . On Friday night a diverse crowd of more than 400 gathered to grieve at First Baptist Church down the street from the bar . They offered their prayers to the Kuchibhotlas and the Madasanis characterized the shooting as an anomaly in an otherwise peaceful tolerant suburb and vowed they would not let that change .

Susan Beachy Doris Burke and Alain Delaqurire contributed research . It is also a sign that General McMaster a veteran of the Iraq war known for his sense of history and independent streak might move the council away from the ideologically charged views of Mr . Flynn who was also a three-star Army general before retiring . Wearing his Army uniform General McMaster spoke to a group that has been rattled and deeply demoralized after weeks of upheaval following a haphazard transition from the Obama administration and amid the questions about links to Russia which swiftly engulfed Mr . Flynn . General McMaster several officials said has been vocal about his views on dealing with Islamic militancy including with Mr . Trump who on Monday described him as a man of tremendous talent tremendous experience . General McMaster got the job after Mr . Trumps first choice Within a day of his appointment on Monday General McMaster was popping into offices to introduce himself to the councils professional staff members . The staff members many of them holdovers from the Obama administration felt viewed with suspicion by Mr . Trumps team and shut out of the policy-making process according to current and former officials . In his language General McMaster is closer to the positions of former Presidents Barack Obama and George W . Bush . Both took pains to separate acts of terrorism from Islamic teaching in part because they argued that the United States needed the help of Muslim allies to hunt down terrorists . There is a deep hunger for McMasters view in the interagency he added referring to the process by which the State Department Pentagon and other agencies funnel recommendations through the National Security Council . The fact that he has made himself the champion of this view makes people realize they have an advocate to express dissenting opinions . But Mr . McCants and others cautioned that General McMasters views would not necessarily be the final word in a White House where Mr . Trump and several of his top advisers view Islam in deeply xenophobic terms . Some aides including the presidents chief strategist Stephen K . Bannon have warned of a looming existential clash between Islam and the Judeo-Christian world . Known for challenging his superiors General McMaster was nearly passed over for the rank of brigadier general in 2007 until Gen . David H . Petraeus who used his counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq and Robert M . Gates then the defense secretary rallied support for him . The schisms within the administration could be aired publicly if the Senate Armed Services Committee exercises a right to hold a confirmation hearing for General McMaster . Although the post of national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation senators must approve his retention of his three-star rank in a new position . To outside observers the administrations approach to the world appears increasingly schizophrenic . Mr . Pence Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other senior cabinet officers have reaffirmed American support for alliances with NATO and in East Asia . Mr . Bannon and other White House officials continue to suggest there will be radical shifts in American policy . These mixed messages extend beyond the Muslim world . This week Mr . Pence traveled to Brussels to declare on Mr . Trumps behalf he said the strong commitment of the United States to the continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union . But on Thursday the German ambassador to the United States Peter Wittig said his government remains concerned that the White House views the European Union as an ailing inefficient economic club rather than a political project that has kept Europe at peace . Mr . Wittig met Mr . Bannon who told him the White House viewed the European Union as a flawed construct and preferred to negotiate with Germany and other European countries one-on-one . Mr . Wittig declined to discuss the meeting while Mr . Bannon did not respond to a request for comment . Images like this one might look silly but they are rich with insights into the countrys military and politics . By using high-tech forensics and traditional detective work analysts and intelligence agencies can use photos to track North Koreas internal politics and expanding weapons programs with stunning granularity . Several experts walked us through this photo of Kim Jong-un North Koreas leader unveiling what he claimed was a new nuclear device . But the image from March 2016 may show more than Mr . Kim intended: the possible range of the missile behind him his relationship with the military even his precise location . Jeffrey Lewis an analyst at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies used the photo to estimate the devices size from which he deduced its weight a few hundred kilograms and its destructive yield about 20 kilotons roughly equivalent to the atomic bombs that the United States dropped on Japan . Scholars of North Korean state media recognize Mr . Kims jacket from official portrayals of his grandfather Kim Il-sung the nations founding leader . The elder Kim is heavily celebrated in state media and closely associated with the Korean War . Mr . Kim by borrowing his coat is sending a message that North Korea is again on a war footing . Such details help scholars to understand how Mr . Kim is constructing his legitimacy . By mimicking his grandfather he is implicitly breaking with his father Kim Jong-il who tended to rule through institutions like the military and the Communist Party . Instead Mr . Kim is asserting himself as the center of all authority as his grandfather did . This pose can help experts better understand the governments internal dynamics and how it might behave . That sends a clear message: Mr . Kim is asserting that he runs the nuclear weapons program personally cutting out the usual chain of command . This is not rule by the military anymore . This is rule by one man said Joshua Pollack who edits the Nonproliferation Review . Even a glimpse of the intercontinental missile in the background reveals important information . David Schmerler also with the Center for Nonproliferation Studies noticed the white lettering which is Korean for support . Missile airframes are fragile and so have to be rested where the frame is strongest between the internal tanks . They narrowed their search in part by examining photos where Mr . Kim wore the same outfit reasoning that his proclivity for wearing the same clothing over a stretch of time would help them spot patterns . Mr . Pollack also said they could roughly date an undated photo by Mr . Kims weight which tends to fluctuate . That led them to an earlier photo of the missile facility whose tiny architectural details and a banner matched those in the disco ball photo . Propaganda officials had not bothered to hide its location: the Chamjin missile factory just outside Pyongyang . Mr . Lewis has been monitoring the facility ever since . He watches how and when it is used looking for bursts in traffic or new construction . By tracking which facilities are expanded and which are neglected he can infer the same of whichever program a facility houses . Satellite photos show this facility getting a recent upgrade which Mr . Lewis was able to see up close by finding a matching propaganda photo . Such glimpses give him a feel for key weapons centers . He thinks he may even have spotted Mr . Kims car . Ms . Hanham believes some details may have been deliberately revealed to demonstrate the countrys growing capabilities . Whereas most such images are doctored if only to improve Mr . Kims appearance she noticed that this was conspicuously unretouched perhaps a message to the foreign intelligence agencies who conduct such analyses . leaders will gather in two cities this weekend to plot strategy and select a new national chairman with the daunting task of rebuilding the partys depleted organization . But senior Democratic officials concede that the blueprint has already been chosen for them by an incensed army of liberals demanding no less than total war against President Trump . Now spurred by explosive protests and a torrent of angry phone calls and emails from constituents and outraged themselves by Mr . Trumps swift moves to enact a hard-line agenda Democrats have all but cast aside any notion of conciliation with the White House . Instead they are mimicking the Republican approach of the last eight years the party of no and wagering that brash obstruction will pay similar dividends . vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association said there had been a tornado of support for wall-to-wall resistance to Mr . Trump . Mr . Inslee who backed a lawsuit against the presidents executive order banning refugee admissions and travel from seven majority-Muslim countries said Democrats intended to send a stern message to Mr . Trump during a conference of governors in the nations capital . My belief is we have to resist every way and everywhere every time we can when Mr . Trump offends core American values Mr . Inslee said . By undermining Mr . Trump across the board he said Democrats hope to split Republicans away from a president of their own party . Some in the party also fret that a posture of unremitting hostility to the president could imperil lawmakers in red states that Mr . Trump won last year or compromise efforts for Democrats to present themselves to moderate voters as an inoffensive alternative to the polarizing president . Senator Thomas R . Carper of Delaware a middle-of-the-road Democrat up for re-election in 2018 cautioned that loathing Mr . Trump on its own was not a governing strategy . He said he still hoped for compromise with Republicans on infrastructure funding and perhaps on a plan to improve or repair the Affordable Care Act . At times Democratic frustration with Mr . Trump has already flared well beyond the normal range of opposition discourse: In Virginia Tom Perriello a former congressman seeking his partys nomination for governor apologized after calling Mr . Trumps election a political and constitutional Sept . 11 . And in New Jersey Phil Murphy a former Goldman Sachs banker and ambassador to Germany drew criticism in his campaign for governor after likening the current political moment in America to the rise of Adolf Hitler . A handful of liberal groups have already sprung up threatening to wage primary challenges against incumbent Democrats whom they see as insufficiently militant against Mr . Trump raising the prospect of the same internecine wars that plagued Republicans during President Barack Obamas administration . which concludes with a vote in Atlanta on Saturday the restive mood of liberal activists has buoyed a pair of insurgents Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Ind . against the perceived front-runner Thomas E . Perez . Mr . Perez who was Mr . Obamas labor secretary is still viewed as a favorite in the race and he has been backed by former Vice President Joseph R . Biden Jr . But he has struggled to dispel the impression that he is an anointed favorite of Washington power brokers . And Mr . Ellison and Mr . Buttigieg have continued to collect high-profile endorsements: Mr . Ellison won the support of Representative John Lewis of Georgia the civil rights leader on Tuesday and Mr . Buttigieg was endorsed Wednesday by Howard Dean the former party chairman who remains admired on the left . Christine C . Quinn a vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee who was a prominent surrogate for Hillary Clinton last year said she backed Mr . Ellison who was the first Muslim elected to Congress in part because of the forcefulness of his criticism of the White House . This is not a normal Republican president and these are not normal times said Ms . Quinn a former speaker of the New York City Council . This isnt a time for polite parties anymore . This is a time to take a different posture of true aggressiveness . Martin OMalley a former Maryland governor who has endorsed Mr . Buttigieg said impatient Democrats might challenge even members of their own party in their enthusiasm to take on Mr . Trump . Mr . OMalley said the party base plainly wanted leaders who would be willing to fight the fight and where necessary So far the most prominent leaders of the Democratic Partys activist wing including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have not encouraged challenges to sitting Democratic lawmakers who have accommodated Mr . Trump . Mr . Merkley an ally of Mr . Sanders suggested liberals seeking scalps would get no help from progressive senators if they try to unseat Democratic senators from conservative Missouri Montana North Dakota and West Virginia calling those lawmakers perfectly suited to those states . Two mayors in Democratic cities however have gotten a taste of what awaits those who do not bow completely to the demands of the anti-Trump forces: When Carolyn Goodman of Las Vegas a Democrat turned independent and Levar Stoney of Richmond Va . a Democrat resisted deeming their municipalities sanctuary cities each was met with anger from supporters of expanding protection against deportation for undocumented immigrants . Part of what I think the Bernie campaign taught us even the Trump campaign taught us and now the resistance is teaching us is just ditch the consultants and consult with your conscience and constituents first said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii warning his fellow Democrats that its a fools errand to try to plan this out like its a traditional political operation . The fear factor is real said Adam Jentleson a former Senate Democratic aide . Images of angry constituents jeering Senator Sheldon Whitehouse a reliable liberal from Rhode Island at a town hall-style meeting in late January for supporting the selection of The confirmation of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education was a signal moment for the school choice movement . For the first time the nations highest education official is someone fully committed to making school vouchers and other market-oriented policies the centerpiece of education reform . in Economics . Because a stable and democratic society is impossible without widespread acceptance of some common set of values and without a minimum degree of literacy and knowledge on the part of most citizens Mr . Friedman wrote the government should pay for all children to go to school . The voucher idea sat dormant for years before taking root in a few places most notably Milwaukee . Yet even as many of Mr . Friedmans other ideas became Republican Party orthodoxy most national G . O . P . leaders committed themselves to a different theory of educational improvement: standards testing and accountability . That movement reached an apex when the But broad political support for No Child Left Behind proved short-lived . Teachers unions opposed the reforms from the left while libertarians and states-rights conservatives denounced it from the right . When Republicans took control of more governors mansions and state legislatures in the 2000s they expanded vouchers to an unprecedented degree . Three of the largest programs sprang up in Indiana Louisiana and Ohio which collectively enroll more than a third of the 178000 voucher students nationwide . Most of the new programs heeded Mr . Friedmans original call for the government to enforce minimum standards by requiring private schools that accept vouchers to administer standardized state tests . Researchers have used this data to compare voucher students with similar children who took the same tests in public school . Many of the results were released over the last 18 months while Donald J . Trump was advocating school choice on the campaign trail . The first results came in late 2015 . Researchers examined an Indiana voucher program that had quickly grown to serve tens of thousands of students under Mike Pence then the states governor . In mathematics they found voucher students who transfer to private schools experienced significant losses in achievement . They also saw no improvement in reading . of Louisianas voucher program . Students in the program were predominantly black and from low-income families and they came from public schools that had received poor ratings from the state department of education based on test scores . For private schools receiving more applicants than they could enroll the law required that they admit students via lottery which allowed the researchers to compare lottery winners with those who stayed in public school . They found large negative results in both reading and math . Public elementary school students who started at the 50th percentile in math and then used a voucher to transfer to a private school dropped to the 26th percentile in a single year . Results were somewhat better in the second year but were still well below the starting point . This is very unusual . When people try to improve education sometimes they succeed and sometimes they fail . The successes usually register as modest improvements while the failures generally have no effect at all . Its rare to see efforts to improve test scores having the opposite result . Martin West a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education calls the negative effects in Louisiana as large as any Ive seen in the literature not just compared with other voucher studies but in the history of American education research . Theres always the chance that a single study no matter how well designed is an outlier . Studies of older voucher programs in Milwaukee and elsewhere have generally produced mixed results sometimes finding modest improvements in test scores but only for some subjects and student groups . Until about a year ago however few if any studies had shown vouchers causing test scores to decline drastically . was released by the Thomas B . Fordham Institute a conservative think tank and proponent of school choice . The study which was financed by the pro-voucher Walton Family Foundation focused on a large voucher program in Ohio . Students who use vouchers to attend private schools have fared worse academically compared to their closely matched peers attending public schools the researchers found . Once again results were worse in math . that the performance gap between private and public school students had narrowed significantly over time . He argued that the standards testing and accountability movement for all its political shortcomings was effective . The assumed superiority of private schools may no longer hold . that many private schools in Louisiana chose not to accept voucher students and those that did had recently experienced declining enrollment . Perhaps the participating schools were unusually bad and eager for revenue . But this is another way of saying that exposing young children to the vagaries of private-sector competition is inherently risky . The free market often does a terrible job of providing basic services to the poor see for instance the lack of grocery stores and banks in many low-income neighborhoods . This may also hold for education . Others have argued that standardized test scores are the wrong measure of school success . Its true that voucher programs in Washington and some others elsewhere which produced no improvements in test scores increased the likelihood of students advancement and graduation from high school . One study of a privately financed voucher program in New York found positive results for college attendance among African-Americans . on test scores . But while vouchers and charters are often grouped under the umbrella of school choice the best charters tend to be nonprofit public schools open to all and accountable to public authorities . The less private that school choice programs are the better they seem to work . The new evidence on vouchers does not seem to have deterred the Trump administration which has proposed a new $20 billion voucher program . Secretary DeVoss enthusiasm for vouchers which have been the primary focus of her philanthropic spending and advocacy appears to be undiminished . Shortly after the lights went down at the American Airlines Theater on West 42nd Street there was a blur and the brief shining of a flashlight . Three people quickly took their seats several rows back from the stage: Mr . Obama; his eldest daughter Malia; and Valerie Jarrett who was a senior adviser to the president . A woman sitting nearby let out a small yelp but most of the audience at the revival of Arthur Millers The Price did not realize they were watching a Broadway show with someone who was until recently the most powerful person in the world . The play starring Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito Jessica Hecht and Tony Shalhoub centers on two estranged brothers and their quest to reconnect . Well I actually didnt know he was sitting in the row said Laralyn Mowers 37 who lives in Astoria Queens . She was sitting five seats to the right of Mr . Obama and did not realize he was there until a friend told her at intermission . I had a really bad day and it all just changed . Mr . Obama wore glasses during the show . At one point during the second act he and his daughter sat in identical poses: right hands pressed to their chins while intently observing the drama before them . Just before intermission again in darkness Mr . Obama his daughter and Ms . Jarrett were whisked backstage to greet the cast and to take pictures with the crew . Once more most of the crowd was oblivious to his presence . After the play ended the Obamas and Ms . Jarrett joined the crowd in a standing ovation for the cast the most visible they had been all night . Minutes later they were gone . The audience members who managed to see the former president were heard expressing surprise that he had been there . The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons and North Korea is among the worlds largest possessors of such weapons . In 2014 the South Korean Defense Ministry said the North had stockpiled 2500 to 5000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons . The North has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006 . VX is part of a family of nerve agents created decades ago during research into pesticides . It is tasteless and odorless and kills by causing uncontrollable muscle contractions which eventually stop the victim from breathing . A dose of about 10 milligrams is enough to kill by skin contact according to the Federation of American Scientists . North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capability of up to 4500 metric tons during a typical year and 12000 tons during a period of extended crisis . It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons including mustard phosgene and sarin gas a United States Congressional Research Service report said last year . the estranged half brother of Kim Jong-un at the airport for the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur a statement attributed to the North Korean Jurists Committee said the greatest share of responsibility for the death rests with the government of Malaysia because Kim Jong-nam died there . And in what could be seen as a threat to Malaysia the statement noted that North Korea is a nuclear weapons state . Relatives and acquaintances of the two women Malaysia has accused of carrying out the killing by applying poison to Kim-Jong-nams face as North Korean agents looked on insisted they must have been duped into doing so though the Malaysian authorities say otherwise . The statement on Thursday from the Jurists Committee was cited by the state-run Korean Central News Agency in the first comment on the killing from the Norths official news media . The statement accused the Malaysian authorities of pursuing a case full of loopholes and contradictions that proved that its investigators intended to frame us . It said Malaysia had done so under South Korean influence . A day after his secretive chief strategist laid out a hard-edged new definition of conservatism animated by attacks on the administrative state globalism and the corporatist media Mr . Trump delivered a visceral gut punch of a speech that executed almost all of the tactics that define the forever-war philosophy of the Trump-Bannon West Wing . on Friday Mr . Trump launched what was easily the most blistering attack on the media and corporate elites of his already bellicose and eventful presidency . His speech also included a promise to throw undocumented immigrants the hell out of the country and a recitation of his law-and-order campaign promises . It represented a not-entirely friendly takeover of CPAC an establishment Republican group whose leadership once viewed the partys surprise standard-bearer as a noisy interloper . Mr . Bannon the former Breitbart chief executive who has a hand in nearly every scripted public Trump utterance had expressed a similar sentiment at the conference the day before . If you think theyre going to give you your country back without a fight you are sadly mistaken he said during an appearance with Reince Priebus the White House chief of staff . Every day it is going to be a fight . His onstage discussion it turned out was a philosophy-infused preview of Mr . Trumps populist broadsides with an admonition to anyone who continues to underestimate the determination of the Trump White House to disrupt the Washington establishment . Mr . Trumps less restrained approach energized CPAC attendees who had once viewed the developer-turned-reality-star as a self-promotional celebrity curiosity they serenaded him with chants of Trump and U . S . A . And his message is resonating with Republican voters over 80 percent of whom approve of his job performance despite historically low levels of support among all voters . But Mr . Trump is intensifying his assault on his enemies on the eve of his first national address before a joint session of Congress a time when most new presidents are moving in the opposite direction pivoting from martial campaign rhetoric to the more positive inclusive language of governance needed to build the coalition necessary to pass major legislation . On an operational level Mr . Trumps inexperienced but confident White House staff members dominated by Mr . Bannon are leaning on Hill Republicans to draft tax overhaul measures and a replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act . In the meantime they have focused on enacting a series of quick-splash executive orders an approach often adopted by presidents at the end of their terms when their legislative leverage has been exhausted . As they did during the campaign Mr . Trump and Mr . Bannon believe they are tapping into an American public less interested in the standard optimistic tropes of presidential politics and more interested in someone who speaks truth to their anxieties . Moreover aides to Mr . Trump say he fares best when hes able to target and nickname an opponent whether it is Little Marco Rubio Crooked Hillary Clinton or the Fake News media . Mr . Bannon bookish and prone to surrounding himself with like-minded young acolytes previewed Mr . Trumps media-bashing during the Thursday session . Theyre corporatist globalist media that are adamantly opposed adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like The attacks on the news media come at a time when the press has been reporting on the Trump campaigns apparent connections to Russia the botched rollout of Mr . Trumps executive order on immigration and the forced resignation of Michael T . Flynn the national security adviser after less than a month on the job . For all his talk of creating a blueprint for a Trumpian conservatism that outlasts the presidents career Mr . Bannon is not regarded as a detail-oriented manager and he let slip during his CPAC appearance that things in the White House have gone well but only to the degree we were planning them . There is not a lot of daylight between Mr . Trump and Mr . Bannon on the issues although the president often jokes that Mr . Bannons economic populist agenda makes it hard to tell if the former Naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive is alt-right or alt-left according to a Trump associate friendly with both . The biggest difference between the president and his chief strategist is that Mr . Trump is far less constrained by the dictates of any single philosophy even Mr . Bannons vision of Trumpism than Mr . Bannon who sees history as a succession of movements and power struggles . He unleashed the latest in a succession of surprise rhetorical attacks on longstanding American allies extemporizing about a friend named Jim who had told him to avoid the City of Lights because after several terrorist attacks Paris is no longer Paris . Clearly reveling in the adulation of a room that had once been hard to win the president alternated between a theme of dark days once again singling out violence on the streets of Chicago and light comedy . Speaking of a meeting with business leaders this week that included food producers he quipped I like Campbells soup . I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news Mr . Trump said . Its fake phony fake . They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly . But as you saw throughout the entire campaign and even now the fake news doesnt tell the truth . The day before the election CBS and ABC projected Mr . Trump trailing Mrs . Clinton by 4 points with margins of error of 3 points and 2 . 5 points . About 2 . 9 million more people or 2 . 1 percent voted for Mrs . Clinton than for Mr . Trump . NBC showed Mrs . Clinton with a 6-point lead and a margin of error of 1 point . Under the countrys visa waiver program citizens from some 30 countries are allowed to enter the United States without a visa for up to 90 days . Citizens from other countries must apply for a visa and could be rejected; waiting times vary . Refugees who are referred to resettlement in the United States typically wait up to two years . The $6 trillion figure is the high end of credible estimates of the total cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as nation building and personnel costs . But this price also includes costs to come such as future spending for veterans health care and disability . The left-leaning Urban Institute estimated that 2 . 6 million plans were canceled because they did not meet minimum requirements set by the act . But fewer than one million people ended up with no insurance at all and it is not clear that this was entirely attributable to The number of troops will be reduced by the 2018 fiscal year a result of pulling out of wars in the Middle East a position Mr . Trump falsely says that he has espoused since the United States first invaded Iraq . The United States has the most sophisticated naval fleet in the world with 10 aircraft carriers compared with Russias one .
