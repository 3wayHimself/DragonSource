Musks lengthy email was sent to all Tesla employees and addresses all areas of concern raised by Moran including safety compensation and work hours . The Tesla CEO said claims about improper safety controls are unfounded based on investigation of both Morans specific team and the factory in general . In fact Musk says the companys accident rate is less thanhalf that of the larger auto industry on average . Musk also charts compensation factoring in equity-based compensation and benefits to display a considerable pay advantage vs . the big three automakers . Of course that depends on stock remaining stable or improving through vesting periods . Regarding work hours Musk said that the company has dropped overtime hours by 50 percent since last year and hopes to continue to improve those numbers through Model 3 production . Curiously Musk also concludes with a section on Fun in which he discusses non-tangible employee benefits on the road map like frozen yogurt stands distributed throughout the factory and an electric roller coaster intended to help employees get around the Fremont campus in a unique way including an optional loop the loop . For Tesla to become and remain one of the great companies of the 21st century we must have an environment that is as safe fair and fun as possible . It is incredibly important to me that you look forward to coming to work every day . For that we must be a fair and just company the only kind worth creating . This is vital to succeed in our mission to accelerate the advent of a clean sustainable energy future . The forces arrayed against us are many and incredibly powerful . This is David vs Goliath if David were six inches tall ! Only by being smarter faster and working well as a tightly integrated team do we have any chance of success . We should never forget the history of car startups originating in the United States: dozens have gone bankrupt and only two Tesla and Ford have not . Despite the odds being strongly against us my faith in you is why I am confident that we will succeed . That is why I was so distraught when I read the recent blog post promoting the UAW which does not share our mission and whose true allegiance is to the giant car companies where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla . The workplace issue that comes before any other is safety . If you do not have your health then nothing else matters . Simply due to size and bad luck there will always be some injuries in a company with over 30000 employees but our goal is simple: to have as close to zero injuries as possible and be the safest factory in the auto industry by far . The Tesla executive team and I are absolutely committed to this goal . That is why I was particularly troubled by the safety claim in last weeks blog post which said: A few months ago six out of eight people in my work team were out on medical leave at the same time due to various work-related injuries . I hear the ergonomics are even more severe in other areas of the factory . Obviously this cannot be true: if three quarters of his team suddenly went on medical leave we would not be able to operate that part of the factory . Furthermore if things were really even worse in other departments that would mean something like 80% or more of the factory would be out on injury production would drop to virtually nothing and the parking lot would be almost empty . As you know firsthand we have the *opposite* problem there is never enough room to park ! In fact we are working at top speed to build more parking . Also hopefully our darn BART train station will open before all hell freezes over ! That said reducing excess overtime and improving safety are extremely important . This is why we hired thousands of additional team members to create a third shift which has reduced the burden on everyone . Moreover since the beginning of Tesla production at Fremont five years ago there have been dedicated health and safety experts covering the factory and we hold regular safety meetings with operations leaders . Since the majority of the injuries in the factory are ergonomic in nature we have an ergonomics department focused exclusively on this issue . Of course the goal is to have as close to zero injuries as humanly possible so we need to keep improving . If you have a safety concern or an idea on how to make things better please let your manager safety representative or HR partner know . You can also send an anonymous note through the Integrity Hotline this applies broadly to any problems you notice at our company or you can email safety@tesla . com . At Tesla we believe it is important for everyone to be an owner of the company . This is your company . That is why unlike other car companies everyone is awarded shares and you get to buy stock at a discount compared to the public through the employee stock purchase program . Last year stock equity grants were increased significantly and it will happen again later this year once Model 3 achieves high volume . The chart below contrasts the total comp received by a Tesla production team member who started on January 1 2013 against the total comp received over the same period at GM Ford and Fiat Chrysler . A four year period is used because thats the vesting length of a new hire equity grant . I believe the equity gain over the next four years will be similar . As shown below a Tesla team member earned between $70000 and $100000 more in total compensation than the employees at other US auto companies ! These changes have had a big impact . The average amount of hours worked by production team members this year is about 43 hours per week . The percentage of overtime hours has declined by almost 50% since the super tough time we had last year achieving rate on the Model X which is probably the hardest car to build in history . What an amazing accomplishment ! It is also a lesson learned which is why Model 3 is designed to be dramatically easier to manufacture . As we get closer to being a profitable company we will be able to afford more and more fun things . For example as I mentioned at the last company talk we are going to hold a really amazing party once Model 3 reaches volume production later this year . There will also be little things that come along like free frozen yogurt stands scattered around the factory and my personal favorite: a Tesla electric pod car roller coaster with an optional loop the loop route of course ! that will allow fast and fun travel throughout our Fremont campus dipping in and out of the factory and connecting all the parking lots . Its going to get crazy good Tech news was heavy this week . Uber is facing a sexual harassment claim as well as a lawsuit from Google NASA discovered planets with what could prove to be Earthlike conditions and more information was revealed about Apples new Apple Park campus . These are the top stories of the week . outside of our solar system about 40 light-years away . These new planets all inhabit another solar system and orbit a star called TRAPPIST-1 . So far we know that theplanets have awarm climateand rocky terrain promising signs forwater and therefore life . Mark Zuckerberg released a 5000 word product road map for Facebook last week in which he outlined the companys humanitarian efforts . Another chunk of the piece was an ask to users to define content guidelines for what theyfeel is offensive or not . However the question may bewhether or not any additional data Facebook gathers from users witha content threshold setting will becomeIf youve read the latest headlines about Britains tech industry youd think the country hadnt been rocked by the greatest political and economic uncertainty since the Second World War . Not only are UK startups raising record amounts of funding year on year but tech giants like Amazon are investing and doubling down on the UK economy as if the mood music was taken straight froma dance scene inLa La Land . Surely Brexit Britain is booming ? This week Amazon said it would hire5000 people across the UK this year boosting its headcount by a quarter when it moves into new offices in Londons Shoreditch . Atleast 500 of thosenew jobs will be in Amazons newresearch and development centres in Edinburgh Cambridge and London which has a hand in developing technology forAlexa drones and Prime Video . It was hailed as clear sign of the ecommerce giants long-term commitment to Britain . But of course 4500 of these jobs will be in its packing warehouses across the UK . That saidAmazon did add3500 new jobs in the UK in 2016 andopened its first UK AWSdata centres in London . Doug Gurr Amazons UK country manager made it all sound pretty sexy emphasising all types of roles from flight-test engineers software engineers and corporate managers whilefleetingly mentioning the fulfilment roles in our fulfilment centres when speaking to the FT . In November last yearGoogle said it would hire an additional 3000 people in its London office over the next few years . Soon afterFacebook said it would hire an extra 500 employees in the UK in 2017 boosting its British headcount by 50 per cent . The first highlighted a criticalfall-off in the STEM skills held by the UKs population due to alack of governmentfunding . The second sounded alarm bells overvisa restrictions leading toa tightening ofthe numbers of high-skilled specialists from overseas . Right now the tech sector accounts for 16 percent of U . K . domestic output and 3 million workers or10 percent of all jobs in the U . K . By contrast manufacturing accounts for 10 percent and construction accounts for 6 percent . As you can probablygather most people work in theservice economy . digitally skilled workers by 2020 to satisfy its growing tech economy . Software developers are the most sought-after accounting for 27 percent of vacancies . But at the moment the UK isthe bottom division internationally when it comes to the proportion of teenagers studying math to a high level . Separately Coadec warned that restrictions on the availability of high-skilled specialists from overseas risks choking off a major growth sector of the U . K . economy . Its calling for a special visa to allow qualified people to enter the U . K . and seek work in the digital economy given that But is it easy to hire techworkers from overseas in the UK ? Almost 70 percent of respondents to the Codec survey said bureaucracy and time is already a major barrier and many saidthey were put off by the red tape and around 6000 in legal feesto make a single hire . Of course we can expect that to get so much easier and cheaper after the UK leaves the EUWhile the media and politicianstrumpet a few thousands tech jobs created in Amazons packaging centres it turns out that the UK tech industry and especially startups is facing a huge shortfall in the number of people it requires to feed its economy and with continuing uncertainty over the status of EU workers in the UK due to Brexit . What are we to make of this huge divergence in views ? On the one hand thetech giants seem to be doubling down . But at the startup end of the spectrum where the pockets are not nearly so deepthey are enormously concerned about were they are going to get their future talent . Aquarter of the value of commercial property deals that were in the market on June 23 the day of the EU referendum fell through . Any savvy person at one of the above tech companies would immediately have sealed a sweet deal on their new office at that point . Andaround 3 . 5bn worth of commercial property transactions have failed since the UK voted to leave the European Union . Although values have held up all this uncertainty will have likelyallowed the tech giants to play hard ball with propertydevelopers . Lets also remind ourselves that while Amazon is moving into thefamousShoreditch areawhere Londonstech startup boom originated 10 years ago its now aplace weremost earlystartups must huddle together in packedco-working spaces often unable to afford office spaces of their own . Then theres the currency . With the Pound crashing to the floor in recent months its become cheaper than ever before to hire in the UK which remains the simplest and easiest place in Europe to both hire and crucially fire when needs be . The salary bills in the UK are currently making Financial Controllers weep with joy . Is seems like Brexit Britain might well be a Shangri-La for a certain type of tech industry which has deep pockets access to international currency reserves and plenty of property lawyers . But where the future of its innovation sector its startups and entrepreneurs is concerned its not looking at Shangri-La so much as La La Land singing a much sadder tune . CEO and co-founder Jane Poynter explained in a press conference that World View is at heart a stratospheric flight and exploration company . This means that it sends gas-filled balloons to the very edge of space complete with payloads that could include imaging and sensor suites . Others have done this in the past but the challenge has been in doing this in a way that will allow the balloon craft called stratollites by World View involved to stay in a relatively fixed location a game-changing capability for upper-atmosphere operations . Poynter noted her company is entering a market where theres been a lot of excitement lately commercial spaceflight . But while theres been a lot of activity from private players including SpaceX and Blue Origin Poynter said that the stratosphere where World View is focused has been traditionally ignored as a business opportunity . Yet it presents a considerable one she says . Being able to hover over a specific location for extended periods could have tremendous benefits on the battlefield she notes but also for first responders and in research settings . Poynter brought up hurricanes as an example . Aeroplanes and UAVsoften fly over hurricanesgetting pinpricks of data but these result in inaccurate predictions regarding storm system movements because theyre incomplete . You could in theory move people out of the way of a storm at huge cost when they dont need to be moved just because your predicted trajectory is off . A stratollite positioned over a hurricane over a longer period of time can provide an understanding with great accuracy of the path it will take which canprevent unnecessary evacuations or can help evacuate people who otherwise would not be evacuated Poynter suggested . The spaceport itself is a large impressive site . Its the only building in the world built for the sole purpose of stratospheric flight Poynter says . The building is 600 feet long in order to house manufacturing tables where we make our large high-altitude balloons . These balloons are laid out on these long tables which run to 1/10th of a mile at their longest . The building also provides a dedicated mission control for balloons and for stratollites which looks a bit like a cross between a small university classroom and the NASA mission control rooms youre probably familiar with from television and movies . This sits next to a 100 foot-tall tower which allows World View to service its balloons and prepare them for launch . World View conducted a nationwide search to identify a location to place this facility . Both Poynter and her CTO and co-founder Taber McCallum already had roots here with their previous company but Poynter says it was a business choice that made the company stay here . They entertained exciting offers from Florida and New Mexico she said but it was this facility with co-located spaceport and manufacturing along with proximity to the airport that made it happen . The whole thing was also itself a feat of engineering . It was built in just over a year a pace Poynter says is lightning speed for a facility like this one . Former astronaut and co-founder Mark Kelly also added that Tucson has great weather for these kind of operations which is key because the biggest threat to successful launches for World Views balloons is high winds . Kelly shed some light on why the stratosphere has been such a neglected area in space exploration and travel . Theres not enough air for airplanes and you also cant put a traditional spacecraft there and keep it there he said . But stratollites thread that needle and this has potential not just for experimentation and remote observation it could spark a new tourism industry . Kelly said that this isnt just about flying stratollites but about flying people too . World View is pursuing this opportunity through an experimental program it calls Voyager which will eventually have a capsule with the capacity to hold six passengers and two crew plus a washroom and take them up via balloon too . This would enable everyday people tourists the ability to see our Earth as a ball floating in the blackness of space Kelly said . Thats a transformative experience he said and I lack the personal perspective to suggest the former astronaut could be incorrect about that . Its not going to be open to everyone of course but Kelly said they could potentially offer thousandsof people worldwide the ability to go to space and he added that World View could potentially do this in many spots around the world eventually . Itll be expensive of course: The starting price for tickets is around $75000 right now and Poynter says that could get more expensive because of demand in the near term . Eventually though it hopes to get it down to $50000 or even $25000 through economies of scale . How soon could World View start putting people up in space ? Theres no definite timeline yet but it hopes to fly an aerodynamic test vehicle this year that will show how their future capsule will behave in real-world conditions . Kelly also told me that its possible they could be flying their first missions with human pilots on board within the next couple of years . Co-founder and CTO Taber McCallum explained why stratollites are possible now but havent been used or created before . He said that they got the idea for commercializations of this tech when they were working on Alan Eustaces record-setting free-fall jump in 2014 . We were working on the Alan Eustace flights and we started getting a bunch of incoming requests to fly payloads and satellites he said . We thought the market mustve been already saturated but the calls kept coming in and we got the NASA contract . McCallum said that it was like ballooning had been in stasis no one had applied modern battery tech modern navigation systems or solar energy improvements to the actually very old area of ballooning . Combining aspects of all these improvements World Viewfound a way to use air as ballast and change the buoyancy of the crafts on demand which let them ride stratospheric wind patterns to maintain their position by altering their altitude . The World View vehicle is solar-powered so there isnt any inherent limitation to the duration it can stay in the air . Its also easy to bring it back and swap payloads and then redeploy it . It can land so softly that fine instrumentation survives missions unscathed and can be used again something thats generally unheard of in spaceflight . In fact co-founder Alan Stern explained that balloons remove many of the constraints were used to with spaceflight in general . You can fly very large masseswhereas with rocket launches youre often micromanaging weight . You can fly human experimenters along with research eventually andyou dont have to worry about zero G which is a challenge for a lot of space-based experimentation . Stratollites also operate above the altitude where youre prevented from doing infrared astronomy Stern added . You can directly sample the stratosphere which is useful for monitoring things like the impact of environmental damage . You can usevery small optics for imaging which are inexpensive since dont need large expensive opticsas you do when youre farther away like in space . World View says it has already run north of 50 missions and has clients includingNorthrup Grumman Harvard Arizona State University The Department of Defense and NASA . Earlier this month in fact it formed an important partnership via a new flight with Ball Aerospace . Ball sent up optical instruments with resolution good enough to track individual vehicles on the ground from an altitude of 77000 feet which has obviously interesting implications .
