'Jeopardy' contestant gives Trebek the finger
In the small talk portion of Wednesday night�s �Jeopardy ! College Championship� edition Stanford undergrad Viraj Mehta slyly flipped Alex Trebek the bird while talking about differential geometry and pizza . Mehta a Texas native got going about a theorem in differential geometry �that explains really well why if you fold a slice of pizza the tip stays in the air so you can eat it easily� all the while flashing his own single-digit salute in the air . The brazen gesticulation went on for about seven seconds before Mehta wrapped up his explanation adding that it �was really cool to work out in class . � Trebek appears not to notice when he chalks up Mehta�s theorem to �thick crust . � Twitter of course noticed the stunt and Mehta noticed right back . He confirmed to one user that yes the finger was quite intentional
