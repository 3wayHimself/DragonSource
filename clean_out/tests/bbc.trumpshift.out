PJ Crowley: Trump unveils a subtle but vital shift in US policy
 A playful exchange between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually said a great deal about the dim prospects of a successful negotiation with the Palestinians under current circumstances . [[Q-1]] President Trump said on Tuesday as he rolled out the red carpet for Mr Netanyahu at the White House . The contrast in the tone of the US-Israeli relationship was tangible given the well-documented tension between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama . [[Q-2]] Mr Trump added . [[Q-3]] [[Q-4]] responded Mr Netanyahu . When Mr Trump chided him for not sounding sufficiently optimistic the prime minister quipped [[Q-5]] Actually it's the reality of the Middle East peace process a hall of mirrors with a grim regional reality a host of historical grievances and zero-sum politics that make the odds of a meaningful negotiation remote much less an actual agreement .

[[Q-6]] Mr Trump observed correctly . However the parties themselves are farther apart on the substance of the process - the borders of a Palestinian state Israeli security arrangements within a Palestinian state the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem - than they were at the end of the Clinton administration . What will Trump mean for Israel ? Is one homeland the solution ? Blame and bitterness keeping peace at bay Both the Bush and Obama administrations expended considerable effort to close existing gaps and achieve at least a framework agreement that would set the stage for a final deal . Neither was successful . Obstacles were less about substance than politics . The centre of Israeli politics has moved markedly to the right; the left that embraced the essential bargain of the Oslo process land for peace has receded . The existing Israeli governing coalition is not wired to make concessions . In fact it is pushing Mr Netanyahu to increase the settlement presence in the West Bank while accelerating construction in East Jerusalem .

Israel reluctantly agreed although some growth continued within settlements Israel would keep in any final deal . Rather than accelerate negotiations settlements became a bone of contention within them . When the 10-month settlement moratorium ended so did direct negotiations . Secretary of State John Kerry tried to achieve a framework agreement during Mr Obama's second term but his one-year effort fell short . In a parting shot at Israel when a resolution came before the UN Security Council declaring settlement activity to be an impediment to peace the Obama administration abstained . President Trump criticised the [[Q-7]] treatment of Israel at the UN a gesture Mr Netanyahu welcomed . Days before the meeting the Trump White House cautioned the Israeli government that expansion of settlements beyond their existing borders was not helpful . Mr Netanyahu may moderate the current pace of settlement activity but he is not going to stop it . The Palestinians will continue to see settlement activity as a fundamental problem .

In 2006 Hamas won an unexpected majority of seats in the Palestinian legislature over Mr Abbas' Fatah Party . The Palestinians have lacked political unity ever since . Today Hamas not the Palestinian Authority is the de facto government in Gaza . Full elections have not been held in more than a decade . The bottom line is that both sides prefer the status quo to making the politically painful concessions that a negotiation would require . Both Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu hope to pursue an [[Q-10]] strategy building on shared regional concern regarding Iran and radical extremists including the Islamic State group to create momentum to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . While reasonable in theory - Mr Netanyahu spoke of partnership with Arab states in opposition to Iran - co-operation at the governmental level does not necessarily translate to popular support . For many in the region the plight of the Palestinians continues to resonate . Given the limited prospects confronting a two-state solution - progress that likely requires different leaders and mandates on both sides - President Trump made a small but significant adjustment in US policy expressing a willingness to support a one-state solution if both parties agree . But the two sides have very different visions of what a one-state solution looks like . A Palestinian man watches a joint press conference by U . S .

On the other hand in any agreement Palestinians would insist on citizenship voting rights and a government of and for the people - all of them . This could redefine Israel's identity . President Trump may see his one-state acknowledgement as the opening gambit in a lengthy negotiation . But a one-state solution potentially presents Israel with an existential choice . It can be a Jewish state or a democracy but not both . That is a choice the United States has never wanted Israel to confront since the answer could have grave implications for the US-Israeli relationship .
