Boy, 10, miraculously survives bite from world's deadliest spider
An Australian boy 10 has survived a bite from one of the world�s deadliest spiders after taking a record 12 vials of anti-venom local media reported . Matthew Mitchell was helping his dad clear out the back shed at their home north of Sydney when he was bitten on the finger by a funnel-web spider that had been lurking in his shoe . �It sort of clawed onto me and all the legs and everything crawled around my finger and I couldn�t get it off� he told the Australian Daily Telegraph . His family used his shirt as a compression bandage to try and slow the venom�s spread and rushed him to hospital . The funnel-web spider is among the world�s deadliest spiders . Its venom attacks the nervous system causing foaming at the mouth muscle spasms and potentially death . The spider was caught and taken to the Australian Reptile Park where it will be milked as part of their program to develop anti-venom . The 10-year-old was �as lucky as they get� Australian Reptile Park general manager Tim Faulkner told The Telegraph . Australia is home to a startling number of the world�s deadliest creatures including snakes spiders jellyfish and octopuses . The funnel web is particularly feared but no deaths have been recorded since the anti-venom was developed in the 1980s . In December a girl 5 was rushed to hospital with a swollen leg after suffering a severe allergic reaction to a spider bite . Little Lola Hutton came home from school complaining of an itchy leg and within hours she had developed an agonizing lump �about half the size of a Ferrero Rocher .
