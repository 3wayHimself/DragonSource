Trump worries Nato with 'obsolete' comment
 A statement by US President-elect Donald Trump that Nato is [[Q-1]] has caused [[Q-2]] in the alliance Germany's foreign minister says . Frank-Walter Steinmeier said it was a contradiction of comments made days ago by Mr Trump's incoming defence chief . Mr Trump also said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made [[Q-3]] by admitting more than one million migrants . And he threatened German car makers with high import tariffs . Shares in BMW Volkswagen and Daimler fell after he warned that cars built in Mexico where they have invested in factories would be taxed at 35% if exported to the US . BMW said the company would stick to its plans to open a Mexican plant in 2019 . Mr Trump was giving an interview in New York to two British and German newspapers the Times and Bild at Trump Tower .

Few expected the new transatlantic relationship to echo the warm and trusting alliance nurtured by Angela Merkel and Barack Obama who was a vocal supporter of Mrs Merkel's refugee policy . There is anger too . Germany's outspoken Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel retorted that the migrant crisis was the result of [[Q-4]] . That Mr Trump should take aim at Germany's car manufacturers has also raised eyebrows though few here believe his Congress would approve the 35% tax he appears to be threatening to impose on imported vehicles . Germans were largely unimpressed by Mr Trump during his election campaign and now despite his own German heritage the president-elect is doing little to endear himself . 'Very unfair' Mr Trump called Nato [[Q-5]] because it [[Q-6]] . Nato he said was [[Q-7]] to him but only five of its 28 member-states were paying their fair share and that he said was [[Q-8]] . Figures released by Nato show that just five member-states met or surpassed its defence spending goal - 2% of GDP - last year . What will Trump's foreign policy look like ?

[[Q-10]] the German foreign minister said . At his Senate confirmation hearing last week Mr Trump's choice for defence secretary Gen James Mattis had described Nato as central to US defence and had accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to [[Q-11]] the alliance . Later Mr Steinmeier was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: [[Q-12]] Media captionWatch the convoy of tanks arrive in Poland Only last week the US deployed 3000 soldiers 80 tanks and hundreds of armoured vehicles to Poland in a move by President Barack Obama to reassure Nato allies concerned about a more aggressive Russia . President Putin's official spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday it was too early to give a full response to a suggestion by Mr Trump that US sanctions against Russia over Ukraine could be dropped in return for a nuclear warhead reduction deal . Mr Peskov also denied reports Mr Putin and Mr Trump were going to hold a summit in Iceland . Seven ways the world could change EU 'vehicle for Germany' Mr Trump said the EU had become [[Q-13]] . Referring to the German chancellor's response to an influx of refugees and other irregular migrants in 2015 he said: [[Q-14]] Mrs Merkel responded by saying the EU had to take responsibility for itself . [[Q-15]] she said in Berlin . Her Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said Europeans should show more self-confidence in dealing with Mr Trump . [[Q-16]] he told Bild .

He promised a quick trade deal between the US and the UK after he takes office on Friday but a European Commission spokeswoman reiterated that the UK would not be allowed to engage in formal talks involving a trade deal with the US until 2019 after leaving the EU . Elsewhere in his interview Mr Trump Said Russia's military intervention in Syria had been [[Q-17]] which had created a [[Q-18]] Said Afghanistan was [[Q-19]] while the offensive to retake Mosul from so-called Islamic State in Iraq had turned out to be a disaster Described the Iran nuclear agreement as [[Q-20]] Likened the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 to [[Q-21]] Promised to [[Q-22]] Twitter as president saying [[Q-23]] and respond to [[Q-24]] news A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum . This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria who are likely to be granted refugee status as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants
