 MINEOLA N . Y . ï¿½ Lucille Conlin Horn weighed barely two pounds when she was born a perilous size for any infant especially in 1920 . Doctors told her parents to hold off on a funeral for her twin sister who had died at birth expecting she too would soon be gone . But her life spanned nearly a century after her parents put their faith in a sideshow doctor at Coney Island who put babies on display in incubators to fund his research to keep them alive . The Brooklyn-born woman who later moved to Long Island New York died Feb . 11 at age 96 according to the Hungerford & Clark Funeral Home . She had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease . Horn was among thousands of premature babies who were treated in the early 20th century by Dr . Martin Couney .
