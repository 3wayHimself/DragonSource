#*Your fake and biased news evaluator*

#Introduction
With the growing concern over the veracity and bias of news sources, as well at the rise of "fake news" accusations, we decide that we wanted to create something to programmatically show the trustworthiness of a website.
Using Markov chains and machine learning, we've created a program that reads a news story and evaluates it based on past data in an attempt to categorize the article's veracity and political leanings.
