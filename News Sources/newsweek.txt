Paul Gus parents were angry and confused. Their son, who in 2011 was halfway through a degree in economics and computer science, was on the phone telling them he wanted to pursue something called a Thiel Fellowship. As one of 24 uniquely talented teenagers, hed get $100,000 over two years to start a company he and a classmate had dreamed up. The catch was that hed have to drop out of college.Gus parents had moved from Hebei, China, to Phoenix when he was 6 years old. Theyd never heard of Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire whod co-founded PayPal, then made prescient and extraordinarily lucrative investments in Facebook, Spotify, Yelp and other tech high-fliers. As with most Americans, immigrant or otherwise, their version of the American dream included a college education as the foundation of upward mobility. But as Thiel sees it, todays elite universities are overpriced relics holding back innovation and contributing to a technology deficit that will have disastrous economic consequences. He believes gumptious kids like Gu shouldnt spend their late teens and early 20s piling up debt that will push them into gainful but unrewarding jobs. Instead, they should pursue radical innovation that will benefit society.Thiel suggested he could do a better job than degree-making institutions by giving bright, ambitious adolescents and young adults the freedom to reach for loftier goals. To catalyze their endeavors, his fellowship would offer a monthly stipend and opportunities for mentorship, business guidance and networking.By taking aim at Americas higher education system, Thiel intended to stir up a storm, and he did. Harvard President Larry Summers says the idea is the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade. Higher education needs to change, Summers adds, but using philanthropic dollars to tempt people to drop out of college is a very dangerous idea.Thiel says its Summers and his colleagues who are hawking a mendacious dream. Higher-education costs have increased at twice the rate of inflation, and student debt now tops $1.3 trillion. The rise in debt has coincided with a decline in business startups by adults under 35creating what a recent study by the Kauffman Foundation calls a lost generation of entrepreneurs.Thiel, who predicted the bursting of the tech and housing bubbles, believes the education debt bubble will be the next to explode. Theres been an incredible escalation in price without corresponding improvements in the product, and yet people still believe that college is just something that you have to do. Whenever something is overvalued and intensely believed, thats a sign of a bubble.Part of whats rankling educators like Summers is that Thiels grievances resonate with some of their brightest students. Fellowship officials say that about three-quarters of the 6,000 applications they received last year were submitted by students at top-tier schools like Yale, Harvard, MIT and Stanford. These are kids who have followed competitive but tightly scripted paths that lead to the difficult but somewhat mundane goal of acceptance to a top collegefollowed by a career thats more likely to be remunerative than meaningful. (Finance and consulting, which claim about a third of Ivy League graduates, are examples Thiel likes to cite with scorn.)A creative and entrepreneurial subclass of these students arrives on campus only to realize that the institution theyve worked so hard to get into lacks the flexibility these restless brains crave. Like Paul Gu, Eden Full Goh heard about the Thiel Fellowship in early 2011, when she was a sophomore at Princeton. A varsity rower and budding electrical engineer, Full Goh radiates an energetic self-assuredness much larger than her 4-foot 11-inch frame. At 10 years old, she built her first solar car, then she began working on an invention that uses gravity-fed water and calibrated bimetallic coils to allow solar panels to track the sunboosting output by 40 percent and, as a bonus, spitting out clean drinking water. After graduating from her Calgary, Alberta, high school at 16, she set off for rural Kenya to tweak the prototype.She envisioned the SunSaluter as a sustainable energy source for millions in the developing world. But at Princeton, she says, her education was getting in the way. I had to fit into a rigid system that wasnt created for people like me. The required courses were slowing me down. I wanted to learn what I needed to develop my ideas and get them out there.In March 2011, Full Goh, Gu and 78 other finalists traveled to San Francisco to present their ideas to fellowship judges, many of whom were Thiels friends from the tech and venture capital worlds. About half the winning pitches were ambitious science and engineering projects: John Burnham had a proposal to extract minerals from passing asteroids; Laura Deming was set on eliminating age-related disease, one of Thiels pet interests. Its theoretically possible, said Deming, whod entered MITs biology program at 14, for humans to live for hundreds of years.Others seemed more inspired by tech innovators like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom left Harvard without a degree. The founders of Dell, Uber, Oracle and many other tech high-fliers all dropped out of college early, as did Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jobs became convinced, in his freshman year, that his degree-path courses at Reed College werent worth what his working-class parents were paying. Once he dropped out, he began dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting. Among them was a calligraphy class that would inspire the Macintosh computers emphasis on typographyone of Apples signature strengths.Gu, who had an idea for a local-commerce website, decided to accept the fellowship over his parents objectionseven though he agreed with them that his chances for entrepreneurial success were low. They thought I was crazy to walk away from an Ivy League diploma, says Gu, now 26. But the safe track I was on didnt have much room for growth. I wanted to take on bigger challenges.Gus soft-spoken Yale classmate and business partner, Daniel Friedman, hesitated to sign on. Professionally, Id gain experience, and if things went horribly wrong I could go back. The real costs were social: Id be leaving my close friends, says Friedman, who eventually accepted the fellowship.Unlike most of the other finalists, Nick Cammarata was an ambivalent student. I had a 2.2 [grade point average] in high school, and I missed 60 school days my senior year, he says. But Cammarata was ambitious about his projects and precociously self-sufficient. At age 9, he insisted he start paying his parents his share of the household utilities. At 10, he was spending up to 80 hours a week experimenting with algorithmic programming. By 16, hed started a Dropbox competitor that attracted 83 million users in 11 months.Those accomplishments prompted the head of Carnegie Mellon Universitys School of Computer Science to override its admissions requirements and enroll him. But at a sleepover weekend for incoming freshmen, Cammarata became disenchanted by his classmates lack of direction and decided to pursue the Thiel Fellowship instead.I wasnt sure what this guy Thiel was up to, says Cammarata, who had an idea for an app that would enable teachers to create and share interactive lessons on tablets. Was it some kind of experiment? Whatever it was, it seemed a whole lot more interesting than going to college.Peter Thiel has been trying to rewire the world to his liking since he arrived in Silicon Valley as a Stanford University freshman in 1985. PayPal, which he co-founded in 1998, was never intended to be merely a handy replacement for checks and money orders. Its founding vision, as he wrote in the libertarian journal , was to create a new world currency, free from all government control and dilutionthe end of monetary sovereignty.After selling the company to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002, Thiel began shopping for other dot-coms that could force change on the existing social and political order and create a new world. In 2004, he was the first outsider to bet on Facebook, with a $500,000 angel investment that would earn him a reported $400 million. He saw social medias utility in libertarian terms, as a means to create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states.More recently, Thiel has irked Silicon Valley with his support of Donald Trump and rankled journalists with his behind-the-scenes funding of an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by Terry Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan. The $140 million judgment bankrupted Gawker Media, publisher of a tech blog that had nine years earlier outed Thiel as gay.Though vengeance was clearly the motivation with the Gawker lawsuit, Thiel often seems to be driven by what PayPal co-founder Max Levchin calls the sheer contrariness of what he is doing. One of his signature questions for fellows and job candidates is: Tell us something about the world that you think is true that most people think is not true.Thiel also believes that society and its most influential subsets could do betterand that he can be a force for positive change. The manifesto of his Founders FundWe wanted flying cars, but we got 140 charactersexpresses the venture capitalists frustration with the shallowness of Silicon Valleys ambitions.Thiels jabs at higher education are attacks on a much more vaunted American institution. At one point, he considered starting his own university, according to Michael Gibson, who, along with Danielle Strachman, was hired to oversee the fellowship program. Thiel dropped the idea because, Gibson says, it seemed too complicated and too much like surrendering to the system.Thiel wanted his fellowship to be flexible, with no constraints on where or how fellows spend their time. Gu, Cammarata, Full Goh and several other fellows headed to the San Francisco Bay Area within a few months, joining the quickening stream of young talent arriving to take a shot at startup stardom. study, the average New York City tech founder is a college grad who first spends nearly a decade working for an established company. But the Bay Area increasingly attracts young people who see little reason to get a degree before founding a company (or going to work for Google or the other tech giants that no longer require diplomas). That hacker mindsetthat the world is malleable and ripe for innovationcoupled with the areas ever-deepening wells of capital has created something of a post-credential economy in Northern California.The Thiel fellows were ostensibly better-equipped than many of the arrivistes, with their $4,000 monthly stipends and their benefactors name behind them. But other support was at first scant. It was up to the fellows to find work space and seek out mentors, to set goals and figure out how to achieve them. Apart from quarterly check-ins, the teenagers had absolute freedom to build their own structure.The problem is that that works for only a very small subset of the population at that age, says first-year fellow Dale Stephens, who applied for the fellowship with what he now calls a very bad idea for an airline.It was hard for a lot of us to adapt, says Full Goh, going from an environment where someone tells you what to do every moment to one where you can do whatever you want. I spent a lot of days wasting time on email.Gu, who had amicably parted with Friedman, had a surfeit of enthusiasm but only a rough sense of what his product and company would look like. I was pitching ideas around, having lunch with lots of smart people. It was exciting at first, but we were losing focus. I was frustrated. I started to wonder why Id dropped out.Away from their circles of family and friends and expected to build companies from scratch, several first- and second-year fellows reported problems with depression. I was living in the cheapest place I could find in Silicon Valley, coding all day and most of the night, says Cammarata, who had teamed up with fellows David Merfield and John Marbach to develop the lesson-sharing app, which they named Tablo. Id thought Id come out and be mentored by Zuck and [Elon] Musk, Cammarata says with a smile, but there were no classes and no meaningful mentorships. We had no idea how to build a business. I realized it wasnt what I wanted; I wanted to be in college, to party and make friends.Marbach, whod left Wake Forest University, quickly realized that Silicon Valley has few social spaces for nondrinking minors. I could get access to any CEO or VC, which was great, but I couldnt find anyone to hang out with. Marbach decided to leave the fellowship and return to Wake Forest. Fellow David Luan went back to Yale.I knew growing a business would take time, says Friedman, who had shifted to an online-education venture. But after 18 months, my friends were getting close to graduationthis big goaland theyd ask me what was going on with my company. It started to get embarrassing.By late 2012, with a second class of fellows coming in, Thiel had disciples but no radical innovation., Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa found that 45 percent of undergraduates at 24 institutions showed no significant improvement in a range of skillsincluding critical thinking, complex reasoning and writingduring their first two years at college. The authors attributed the poor performance to the distractions of socializing or working and a collegiate culture that doesnt prioritize undergraduate learning.But there are some things colleges do better than any other institution. A campus provides a structured, semi-guided transition into adulthood and opens up diverse worlds of people and ideas. A motivated student can learn how to write eloquently or apply quantitative skills to scientific discovery. And a university is a great place to test ones interests and meet lifelong friends, mentors and romantic partners.Thiels degreesa B.A. and a J.D. from Stanfordwould seem to have served him well. But the investor, who is now worth about $2.7 billion, says he was guilty of not carefully considering his education. I didnt know what else to do, and I didnt want to take responsibility for really thinking about my future.In the 30 years since Thiel was a freshman, college has become a much more expensive place to find oneself. For some people, its still worth it, he says. But a lot of graduates cant get good jobs; theyre saddled with debt and moving back home with their parents. People are starting to see that something has gone wrong.Skipping college to try to build the next Uber or Airbnb might seem a seductive option, but for every Zuckerberg or Jobs there are thousands of college quitters whose big ideas sputter. America's 30 million college dropouts are much more likely than graduates to be unemployed and living in poverty. Though the return on a higher-education investment may be declining, adults without degrees earn, on average, only $23,900 per yearless than half the average of college graduates.Whats missing from the fellowship narrative, says second-year Thiel fellow Dylan Field, who left Brown University after his junior year, is that college is very useful for a lot of people. I actually loved it. But I wanted to build a business, and the fellowship was a way to accelerate that.A former child actor who grew up in Californias Sonoma County, Field attended a technology-focused high schoolThe robotics team was like the football team, he saysand had college internships at LinkedIn and OReilly Media. During a summer stint at Flipbook, he came up with an audacious plan to take on software giant Adobe by building a better and cheaper suite of creative tools for designers.As Field and other second-year fellows moved to the Bay Area, bonds began to build. Cammarata, Deming and others rented a big house in Palo Alto. Starting with five people, the group grew to eight or nine housemates. We had a 6-foot-4 guy living in a closet at one point, Cammarata says. That was my pseudo-dorm experience, complete with the soul-searching 2 a.m. conversations. Things started to get fun at that point.The program began adding structure to fill some of the college-like gaps. Incoming fellows got help finding group housing in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and the fellowship started sponsoring more seminars, dinners and mixers where fellows could mingle with one another and with tech-industry titans and angel investors. They also brought in a psychologist to help those who were struggling emotionally. We underestimated how important community would be for the fellows, Thiel says. That was our biggest mistake the first year.To Field, the social component was as important as the money. Entrepreneurship can be a very solitary act. To have good people going through that with you is wonderful.Thiel hosted some events at his house; other hosts included angel investor Kevin Hartz (Airbnb, Pinterest, Uber) and Roger Dicky, a serial entrepreneur whose startups include the  game and software developer Gigster. Wed be up on a rooftop of a mansion on a mountain, hobnobbing with the billionaires who built Silicon Valley, Cammarata says, and these guys seemed so thrilled to be interacting with people so young. They all wanted to help, to get involved.Tablo was the first company founded during the fellowship to be sold. Momentum was building for other fellows too. Field quickly raised $4 million for his company, Figma. Gu, who had abandoned his original idea, crossed paths with two Google Enterprise executives looking for their next project. The three teamed up and raised a $1.75 million seed round for a lending platform on which investors back young up-and-comersa Kickstarter for people, as Gu put it.That idea eventually morphed into Upstart, which loans money using innovative algorithms Gu developed to evaluate earning potential and other factors, rather than traditional credit scores. Gu would eventually locate what he says is a very meaningful portion of our investors through fellowship networks.By imitating aspects of the college experience, the fellowship has begun to look a little more like the institutions its founder railed against. There are signs the influence has flowed in the opposite direction as well. Over the past six years, universities that have lost students to the Thiel Fellowship or Y-Combinator (an early-stage tech incubator in which Thiel is a partner) have introduced an array of options to support students entrepreneurial passions while keeping them on campus.Harvards Innovation Lab (i-lab) serves as a financing and mentoring resource for students who are pursuing innovative startups, and the Yale Entrepreneurial Institutes Innovation Fund offers up to $100,000 to fledgling companies. David Luan, who left the Thiel Fellowship after one year, turned to Yales fund to help finance his visual-analysis software company, Dextro. Wharton, Columbia, Northwestern and several state universities have also started incubator and accelerator programs.To Thiel, these moves dont get at what he sees as higher educations underlying problems: the still-rising costs, the questionable value, the exclusivity. The elite universities do some good things, he says, but the core lie they tell is that their version of an education is an inherently positive thing that everyone has access to.The reality, says Thiel, is theyre running a Studio 54 nightclub with a long line outside and a few people inside dancing. If Harvard wanted more of the world to benefit, they could open it up, franchise it to reach more people. Of course, any Harvard president who suggested that would find an alumni lynch mob at his door. Their sense of identity comes from exclusion.And yet, Thiel doubts he will expand his program beyond the current limit of 30 new fellows per year. We have to be careful for it not to become just another monolithic credentialing system. With a small group, were able to work with them individually and create specific opportunities and make meaningful connections to people they need to meet.Thiels attempt to rescue high-potential kids from conformist, degree-making institutions has transformed into a club that is, arguably, far more exclusive than any of the schools the fellows abandoned.The Thiel pedigree almost guarantees that investors will at least listen to fellows pitchesand very often, they respond favorably. By the third year, Gus Upstart had raised a $6 million series A round and had 10 employees. Dylan Field brought in another $14 million and expanded his Figma team to 14 designers, engineers and marketing people. With the release of a beta version, the design community began to buzz about Figmas real-time collaborative editing capabilities, a feature that gave it a leg up on Adobe. Full Goh, whod decided to incorporate SunSaluter as a nonprofit, pulled in $500,000 in grants and racked up a million air miles as she set up distribution and manufacturing bases in Africa and India.Other fellows who became adept at raising money struggled at running a business. Stanford dropout Tom Curriers company, which managed urban co-living properties, collapsed after two years, forcing evictions. Andrew Hsuwho at 19 had been a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience at Stanfordraised $1.5 million from heavy hitters like Google Ventures for his educational gaming startup, Airy Labs, which laid off most of its 20 employees in 2012 amid accusations that the company was a sweatshop that was actually run by Hsus parents.Fellows now must keep the programs staff updated on revenue, expenses and cash flow. We want to know so we can help them if they need to step on the gas and grow faster, or if theyve only got six months cash left, says Jack Abraham, who came on as executive director when Gibson and Strachman left to start a venture fund to meet the capital needs of fellowship alumni and other misfit young entrepreneurs. Abraham has also developed a comprehensive mentoring program to help fellows with some of the bigger challenges of growing a company, including fundraising, team building and user acquisition.By far the biggest change is in the types of projects new fellows are bringing in. Despite Thiels stated goal of spurring advances in areas like biomedical technology, transportation and energy, each successive class has looked increasingly like the programs creator and Silicon Valley. There are few ambitious hard-science projectsnuclear fusion energy, cancer cures, immunotherapythat might jump-start the radical innovation Thiel envisioned when he founded the program.We started with the perspective that we needed more scientific breakthroughs, but in STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] its harder to start something independently, he says. Its much easier with software, where yourself and a computer can do it with a readily available amount of financing. Now we think about not just whether an applicants idea is inspiring and can change the world but also whether its feasible and has a clear path forward to market.Some of the early fellows have made impressive, if incremental, strides in the fields of photonics, nanotechnology and medicine, but the biggest hits have been the most pedestrian. Harvard dropout Ben Yus Sprayable caffeine is tearing up the market, and investors have sunk tens of millions of dollars into Vitalik Buterins cryptocurrency projects. James Proud raised roughly $40 million for Hello, which makes the Sense sleep tracker, one of several high-tech alarm clocks now hitting the market. In India, Ritesh Agarwal has raised more than $225 million to build an online marketplace for branded budget hotels.What that shows, says Bill Aulet, who directs MITs Global Founders' Skills Accelerator, is that the Thiel Fellowship is fine if you want to do the next Red Bull or dating app or Uberfication, but maybe not if you want to solve cancer or fundamentally change the world.The latest crop of fellows looks very different from the first two classes. Most were recruited via Thiels Bay Area networks rather than selected from the applicant pool. They are older, and many have multiple startup successes under their belts.And so, the question arises: Why do we need a nonprofit fellowship when we already have venture capitalists willing to bet on not-so-big ideas that could well become big businesses?Whether intentional or not, one practical result of the fellowship has been its role as a farm team for Thiel Inc. Friedmans company, Thinkful, was the first to get capital from Thiel, through his FF Angel venture capital fund. Since then, Thiels funds have invested in Gus Upstart and Thomas Sohmerss REX Computing, which designs energy-efficient chips for supercomputing applications. Thiel money has gone into Clay Allsopps Propeller, which creates tools for building mobile apps and which was acquired, in 2014, by Palantir Technologies, the secretive data-analysis company co-founded by Thiel.There are undoubtedly others: When I asked Deming if Thiel or one of his funds had invested in her biotech-focused Longevity Fund or her immunotherapy company, Alexo Therapeutics, she said, Im not sure I can say that. But I guess you can guess. Full Goh and other fellows have also taken jobs at Palantir and served as consultants to the Founders Fund.I asked Thiel, arguably the best talent spotter in Silicon Valley, if the nonprofit program might be considered a means to discover talent and ground-floor investment opportunities.We try to be very careful to keep a super-bright line between nonprofit and for-profit, he said. If there were questions about whether a person whos underwriting a nonprofit somehow profits on the back end, it would open you up to charges of it being somehow self-serving. Our funds don't actually lead the investments, and my investments are very passive, a very small part.Beyond the impressive numbersthe 138 Thiel fellows have collectively raised some $450 million in investments and created $2.5 billion in equity value, more than most college endowmentsThiel believes the fellowship has succeeded in promoting entrepreneurship as a viable alternative to college. Nowadays, entrepreneurship is a line you put on your rsum, he says.But Thiel says the most important gauge of the programs success is whether it has positively affected the lives of the fellows. Of the 22 fellows I spoke witheven those who left the program earlyall but one said emphatically that it had. None of them counted their business success as their greatest gain, though. They claimed that theyd learned far more doing real work and solving real problems than they would have if theyd spent the time in college.Whether Thiels experiment demonstrates a viable alternative to higher education is debatable. The extra time, money and connections certainly accelerated the success of many of this handpicked group of high-achieving outliersbut one could argue that most would have done very well for themselves, eventually, with or without their billionaire patron.Thiels fellowship hasnt given us flying cars or asteroid mining, but it has provoked a long-overdue discussion about the value of higher educationand that may well be its biggest service to society. Even if it turns out to be just a $16 million PR campaign to get parents to think more cogently about their investments in their children's futures, says Dale Stephens, Id say its been tremendously successful.In the six years since the fellowship began, the range of educational alternatives has exploded. With traditional institutions slow to meet the demands of a new generation of students, new players are taking advantage of more accessible technology and changing the way education is conceived and delivered.Some are narrowly focused on skills acquisition, offering a tech-era update to the vocational school tradition that can serve as either a substitute or a practical complement to a liberal arts education. More than 40 million students have taken online, interactive computer-coding courses from Code Academy (co-founded by a Columbia University dropout) and Udemy. Other booming upstarts, such as General Assembly and Hack Reactor, offer a range of online options and bricks-and-mortar boot camps that promise to make a programmer employable in 12 intense weeks for about $15,000.Among the broader and deeper educational options that are emerging, some of the most interesting have come from Thiel fellows. Friedmans company, Thinkful, personalizes distance learning for information technology professionals by combining online lessons with one-on-one mentorship by experienced coders. Stephenss wildly successful UnCollege offers structured gap-year programs for young people who want to drive their own education, explore and make a splash in the world.What separates these new options from traditional learning paradigms is their  la carte nature: Students, rather than administrators, choose what to study. Its the great unbundling, says Gibson. Before, universities had it all tied up in one package. Now that there are cheaper and more relevant alternatives for learning, people are breaking out of these super-narrow tracks. You will start to see fewer people willing to play by the old, bureaucratic, arbitrary rules.Gu, whose online loan platform has raised more than $53 million and employs 100 people, says his parents have finally begun to accept that their son will never get an Ivy League diploma. Of the 43 fellows in the first two classes, Gu is one of 25 who stayed out of college and continued working on their own companies or projects. Six went to work for established tech companies (some through acquisitions). Over the six-year life of the fellowship, only 12 of the 138 fellows have returned to college.Among those dozen returnees, Full Gohs decision to go back to Princeton was perhaps the most surprising. But Full Goh, whose SunSaluter is now boosting solar electricity output in 18 countries in Asia and Africa, did it on her own terms. I strategically picked only the classes I wanted to take, to give me the technical fluency I wanted and to minimize my time on campus.Six months short of graduation, she dropped out again. Once I learned what I needed, I wanted to put those skills to work, she says. There was no point jumping through hoops with required classes for half a year just to get a diploma.As crazy as this might sound to some people, I came to college to learn. Getting that piece of paper means absolutely nothing to me.Donald Trump didn't look very happy to be teased at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner as a private citizen, and he's not going to stomach jokes at his expense as president.Trump announced on Twitter Saturday that he "will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!" Organizers say the annual event, slated for April 29, will still go on despite the president's absence.The dinner, sponsored by the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), is attended by press and politicos and customarily functions as a light-hearted roast of the sitting president and political establishment, with the object of jokes shrugging them off with a smile. Trump, not so much. The then-birther was grim-faced as he enduredmocking in 2011 by both President Obama and comedian Seth Meyers, who took aim at his focus on Obama's birth certificate, qualifications and ambitions."Donald Trump said recently he has a great relationship with the blacks," Meyers said. "Unless the blacks are a family of white people, I bet he's mistaken." The late-night host also joked that Trump "owns the Miss USA pageant, which is great for Republicans because it will streamline their search for a vice president."Obama was less cutting in his remarks and managed to at least elicit a smile or two from Trump during several minutes of jokes. "I know that he has taken some flak recently, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald. And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"This year's White House Correspondents' Dinner already had promised to be a break from the norm due to the toxic relationship Trump and his advisers are avidly pursuing with the press. The president frequently slammed the media on the campaign trail but has made a concerted effort as president to undermine media credibility, calling out specific organizations as "fake news" and going so far as to label the media the "enemy of the American people." His surrogates echo his remarks, with Kellyanne Conway, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and others slamming stories, especially those relying on leaks within Trump's own government, as false and dishonest. Chief Strategist Steve Bannonwho weeks ago advised the press to The annual black-tie dinner is always a source of minor controversy, with some media watchdogs criticizing the affair as a too-cozy evening of journalists and their sources and subjects. Some organizations do decline to send representatives, but expectations are heightened this year due to Trump's assault on the press. Bloomberg, Vanity Fair, and the New Yorker all have already pulled out of parties around the dinner, while CNN and MSNBC are reportedly deliberating whether they'll attend at all, Regardless, the WHCA says Trump's absence won't affect the event.(The dinner)has been and will continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic, WHCA president . We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession.However the evening unfolds, viewers won't have the chance to see an unpopular president enduring a comedian's material, as President George W. Bush did in 2006. Stephen Colbert, then the host of Comedy Central's "Colbert Report," brought his faux conservative persona to the daisto the befuddlement of the president."It is my privilege to celebrate this president because we're not so different, he and I. We both get it. Guys like us, we're not some brainiacs on the nerd patrol. We're not members of the fact-inista. We go straight from the gut. Do you know you have more nerve endings in your gut then you have in your head? You can look it up. Now I know some of you are going to say, I did look it up, that's not true. That's because you looked it up in a book," Colbert said."The greatest thing about this man is he's steady. You know where he stands. He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday, no matter what happens Tuesday."Environmental scholars have gradedScott Pruitt's first speech to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the new agency head barely passed.Id give Pruitt a D+ or a C-, says Chris Sellers, professor of history at Stony Brook University. He showed effort, his writing was not that bad, but his research was pretty thin.A group of historians, scientists andresearchers in the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) took a transcript of the Tuesday speech from one of the Oklahoman's local newspapers and annotated it as they would an academic paper, complete with letter grade. on Thursday, and the full marked-up text is included below.The scholars added citations where context was lacking, commented on word choice, and analyzed what some parts of the administrators speech could mean for the EPA.Sellers and his colleagues at EDGI were surprised to find that Pruitts speech made no reference to the EPAs rich legacy, only mentioning historical events that occurred before the agencys founding. They also found Pruitts remarks about federalism and the role of the states to be ill-informed, especially given that the agency was founded in part due to states unwillingness to implement regulations that met federal standards. They also were extremely wary of Pruitts failure tomention pollution, environmental health or climate change.The speech was notable for what it said, from the history it cited to the principles it enunciated to its choice of words, an introduction to the marked-up document says. Most significantly the address left unsaid the legacies and obligations and thorny implications of EPAs mission and history.%PDF-1.4%

He was first nominated for an award as early as 1994, as a supporting actor in . In the years that followed, he was overlooked for a nomination for his role in the blockbuster film which is tied in Academy Award history for the most nominations and the most wins, 14 and 11 respectivelyand then nominated for lead actor awards for , all of which he lost. It wasnt until last year that he finally took home his first golden statue for his performance in But not every offscreen Hollywood story has ended like Leos. There are dozens if not hundreds of others in the movie business who have been snubbed for particular roles or films, have been nominated multiple times and still havent claimed a statue or have never gotten so much as a nod. Though far from comprehensive, this list features some of the most dizzying instances of actors and directors who have been passed over for Oscar wins and nominations. has been nominated for five acting awards. Since 2006, shes been recognized for her performances in supporting roles in . But he received a total of eight nominations for leading roles that spanned from the 1960s through 2007. He died in 2013 without winning a single standard Oscar, but he did receive an honorary award a decade earlier , which was recognized only in the original screenplay category. Bening was previously nominated four times for the films  scored a best picture nomination as well as one for adapted screenplay and one for Octavia Spencer in a supporting role, its star Taraji P. Henson was shut out of the leading actress category for her portrayal of Katherine G. Johnson. She was nominated but didnt win for her role in and mini-statuette for her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile during the past year, a year that included her iconic performance as Dorothy in but the legendary filmmaker never won that coveted prize. Every time he got close he was passed over for another director, including Elia Kazan, who won for ). Hitchcock was eventually honored by the academy with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1968.. But Close, who has recently won critical acclaim for reprising her Tony award-winning role in the musical  died on January 14, 2016, the same day the academy announced its nominations for last years Oscars. At the ceremony last February he was honored in the annual In Memoriam montage along with others in the movie business who had passed away. But the British actor, known to fans all over the world in more recent years for his portrayal of Severus Snape in the Harry Potter movies, had never been nominated for an Oscar himself. Some of his other famous roles include Colonel Brandon in  is the daughter of three-time Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman and Oscar-nominated director Roberto Rossellini. She was briefly married to the director Martin Scorsese, who after six unrealized nominations finally won an Oscar for  in 2007, and later found a partner for a time in director David Lynch, who has been nominated for four Oscars. But the Italian actress, who lives and works in the U.S., has never even been nominated, despite impressive roles in films like  appears on practically every list of actors unfairly shut out by the academy. The actorwho has been nominated for four Golden Globes and took home one for his role in the television series  seems likely to move off this list in the coming years. But the fact remains thatthe fine British actor has not been nominated for an Oscar. The fact that the academy failed to recognize him for his portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  and snubbed that movies director, as well (though the film was nominated for best picture and won for original song), spurred anger two years ago and was one of several factors that fueled the #OscarsSoWhite outrage.Lawyers have the huge responsibility of representing you in court and therefore selecting an attorney with specialized experience and knowledge in the legal area your case falls into is critical. From personal injury litigation to family law, employment law and commercial litigation, lawyers are integral to ensuring the desired outcomes in your legal cases. Best representation from a law firm could come from either small or large firms. Smaller firms often offer personalized services to clients while larger firms would have attorneys who possess the intimidation factor and backing of reputable partners. Besides that, when it comes to critical issues, you want to have the best personnel representing your affairs.Personal Injury litigators mostly represent their clients based on a contingency fee and will receive their full due upon resolution of the case, enabling those unable to seek legal representation to afford a lawyer. Factors to consider especially in personal injury cases are the lawyers willingness and capability to handle your case in a trial and his or her proven track record in winning settlements or jury trials. Regardless of proving wrongful death of a person or an injury to you, the lawyers burden of proof lies in the strength of their argument or case. Getting a legal team with the ability of sourcing and presenting high-tech evidence and producing an expert deposition will increase the chances of covering all angles during your case.Since cases arising from personal injury lawsuits are complicated and complex, seek attorneys who have specialized in niche cases. For example, a litigator that handles construction related injuries, medical malpractice or motoring accidents. They would play a key role in safeguarding your interest from being exploited and victimized by insurance companies, corporations and the legal system. Complex cases would require the attorney to have experience dealing with cases not from the individual but by a guardian, descendent as well as a large group seeking a class action lawsuit against a company. These litigators are in the position of assisting victims to receive the best possible compensation including potential loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering as well as emotional duress resulting from the injury.The best Family Law Litigators are those who understand the specific needs and intricacies of each case as they present distinctive challenges. The plethora of issues arising from domestic relationships, include civil unions, and other family structures to drafting wills and asset settlements, require the lawyer to have precise knowledge and experience to get you the best outcome possible. As statutes and case laws vary in individual states, be mindful of appointing lawyers who have experience in the respective states. As emotions run high during these proceedings, it is highly important to obtain lawyers who are able to keep calm and be tentative to deal with the complexity of confidential and sensitive family matters.Lawyers representing clients who are dealing with disputes arising from the work place will appear before administrative agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As victims of disputes in employment, employees are left facing inadequate information or wrongful termination without proper compensation; lawyers fill in the lacuna of information by assessing the victims right after the occurrence of adverse employment actions to ensure the adequate representation is filed based on the right ground such as discrimination, wrongful discharge, or unlawful harassment. The field of employment law is highly specialized therefore strong legal representation on employees is crucial as they would possess wide-ranging comprehension on various complexities of employment laws and available claims. Clients will benefit from having lawyers who are highly effective as the proceedings might be costly and lengthy.As clients, most of the concerns will be pertaining to resolution of claims or disputes in commercial transactions that include sales of goods, agreements, bank checks or drafts, installment notes, promissory notes, and bank or electronic fund transfers. Commercial litigators would need to have experience across states, federal courts and private arbitrations. Efficiency, creativity and sound reasoning are critical attributes that position disputes or cases in a favourable outcome. In complex commercial litigation, seasoned lawyers with experience in obtaining or defending against injunctive relief and declaratory judgments would be able to hold their own against corporations. Leading firms would be able to develop and implement a unique approach by effectively determining weak points to exploit and strong points that further strengthen each case, fitting to the scale and merits of the dispute.Law governs our society and in the legal arena the power of a strong reputation cannot be underestimated. Firms with strong portfolios imply a high quality of representation, so often tend to secure esteemed patronage. Its vital to obtain a lawyer who is flexible enough able to work around your schedule as well as having the sharp mind and incisive reasoning to resolve your issues in a timely manner. Shop around and ask for references so you can speak with people they have helped in the past. You deserve the best representation available!The Democratic party took a major stride Saturday in its effort to reorient itself in the era of Donald Trump.In a hotly contested vote, party members tapped former Labor Secretary Tom Perez to be the next Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman, topping his closet rival, Congressman Keith Ellison, after winning a majority of the 442 votes on the second round of balloting. The party faithful, meeting inAtlanta, thenpromptly elected Ellison deputy chair.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and his allies had vocally rallied behind Ellison, touting him as the heir apparent to the liberal movement that Sanders started in last year's Democratic presidential primary. They sought to portray Perez as part of the establishment, given his ties to the Obama administration and as one of the vice presidential candidates on presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's shortlist. While Sanders congratulated Perez in a statement shortly after the election,he also warned the new party chair that,"at a time when Republicans control the White House, the U.S. House, U.S. Senate and two-thirds of all statehouses, it is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before."The reality is, Perez is a pathbreaker in his own right, becoming the first Latino to lead the Democratic party. And his platform was nearly indistinguishable from Ellison's during the several-months-long campaign for chairman. Both men, like the other eight candidates running, emphasized organizing and reconnecting with the party's grassroots, a glaring weakness in their 2016 defeats. Thousandsof those people, however, are now turning out to protest Trump and his policies, a sign of the energy on the left that Democrats hope to capitalize on in the years ahead.His goal as party chair, Perez said in his opening remarks, is "organize, organize, organize." Like his fellow candidates, Perez emphasized the need for Democrats to contest races up and down the ballot and all around the country, from school board to Congress. "We must redefine the role of the DNC so that were not simply electing the president," Perez said, an implicitrebuke of the party during its eight years under President Obama.That was a recurring theme throughout the day and the whole campaign. While Democrats were careful to laud Obama's ability to bring together a national coalition of voters (one that did not show up with the same force for Clinton), the last president also sapped the party of much of its local organizing strength. Obama officials kept much of their national field work,data and organizing capacity separate from the DNC as part ofOrganizing for America, a campaign-like operation run by allies.The result: The party is now staring at an electoral deficit not seen since the 1920s. Not only isTrump in the White House but Republicans control the House and Senate, as well. Since 2008, Democrats also have lost more than 1,000 state legislative seats and a dozen governors mansions. At the most basic level, the next DNC chairmans task is to start to claw back some of those posts. They'll have some prime opportunities in the coming round of elections, particularly in state races. Thirty-six states are holding gubernatorial el`ections in November 2018. Along with state legislative races, those contests will determine who gets to draw district lines after the next Census, in 2020.The challenge for Perez will be how to take a party seething under Trump's reign, but struggling to identify a clear, unifying message. He and Ellisonboth civil rights attorneys by trainingpromised to reenergize the partyand regain the trust of those alienated by a divisive 2016 primary, when hacked emails revealed DNC staff actively working to help the Clinton campaign and push Sanders out. But neither offered many specifics on what he would actually do in the post.The clearest agenda was actually laid out by a young red state politician, Pete Buttigieg, who's in his second term as mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg was considered a dark horse candidate for the post, after impressing senior officials with his eloquence and campaign pitch. Buthe dropped out Saturday before the voting began, saying it was clear he did not have the votes. He did not endorse either Perez or Ellison.In his remarks to the party faithful, Buttigieg urged Democrats to bring people together around their values, not their various identities. And he recommended the party "pay attention to communities like ours, in the middle of the country, not as an exotic species, but as your fellow Americans."On his way to a top altitude of more than 62 miles, test pilot Mike Melvill heard what he described as a tremendous bang from the engine of SpaceShipOne. Thankfully, things ended well on that June day in 2004, with Melvill landing safely in the Mojave Desert, and entering the history books as the first private sector astronaut to reach outer space. Although the source of that distressingly loud noise was not determined, there was speculation within the aerospace industry that rocket fuel had become jammed in the engine. For a second or two, the astronaut didnt know whether the hunk of fuel was going to go out the nozzle or whether the combustion chamber was going to explode, says Sid Gutierrez, a former test pilot and astronaut. It wound up going out the nozzle, so life was good for him that day., is hoping to reduce those risks with its newly patented rocket fuel, made in part with 3-D printers.Unlike most rocket fuel, which is either solid or liquid (NASAs current standard), Rocket Crafterss is a hybrid: part solid, part liquid. The solid is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Its the material Legos are made from, and surprisingly also makes for decent rocket fuel. The liquid is nitrous oxide, familiar to most Americans from whipped cream cans or the dentists chair but used in this case to aid combustion. The two ingredients are kept in different chambers of the rocket engine and gradually combined to produce thrust. Because the ABS and nitrous oxide are held separately and in different forms (solid and liquid), the odds of their accidental mixture and detonation are exceedingly low. The use of hybrid fuel also necessitates a hybrid engine, which is relatively simpler, and thus less expensive, than a liquid-fueled engine.A liquid-fueled rocket can cost from $26 million to$35 million; Rocket Crafters hopes to reduce that figure by up to 80 percent.But the choice of hybrid fuel isnt where Rocket Crafterss biggest innovation lies. Besides being the stuff of Legos, ABS is also one of the primary materials used by 3-D printers. This allows Rocket Crafters to produce solid fuel grains in custom-designed shapes and with precisely placed additives. The geometric design increases each 8-foot-long grains stiffness, which prevents vibrations that can rattle dangerously throughout the engine, while the additives deliver more energy, improving performance while maintaining consistency. Up until now, performance and consistency have been hybrid fuels biggest hurdles to widespread adoption.Rocket Crafters has big plans for its newly patented fuel. Eventually, it will be at the heart of the Intrepid-1, the companys line of launchers intended to deliver communications and imaging satellites into orbit with greater precision than is currently possible. Right now, small satellites blast off 60 at a time on large rockets, meaning companies must essentially carpool, making compromises on where and when their satellites launch. The Intrepid-1 is sized to deliver single satellites at a fraction of the cost.On a longer timeline, Gutierrez is hoping that advancements in safety, cost and reliability will make spaceflight accessible to consumers as tourists. A satellite doesnt get a vote as to what it flies on, he acknowledges, but people do, and they want to fly on the safest thing possible.If Heaven Has a Gate, A Wall and Extreme Vetting, Why Cant America? That was the name of one of the last panels at the Conservative Political Action Conference before the balloons were popped on Saturday afternoon, Media Row broadcasters packed up their makeshift studios, and everyone left the Gaylord National Harbor Resort & Convention Center in Maryland until next year. The title, of course, says it all. The Trump takeover of CPAC is complete, at least for now. Kellyanne Conway joked that CPAC should be called TPACfor Trumpand she was greeted with laughter and applause for a reason.When a party takes power, its members try to paper over differences. When I went to CPAC in out years, there was plenty of vitriol for the Democratic president, whether it was Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but also a robust debate about what went wrong and how to go forward. This year there was much less of that. In 2015, when Laura Ingraham, the broadcaster and Trump supporter, interviewed Chris Christie, the tension was palpable as she portrayed him as a squish and softie on immigration. In other speeches, the endless cavalcade of Republican candidates had offered differing visions of conservatism. There was Jeb Bushs big-hearted belief in more immigration and education reform that included Common Core or Rand Pauls libertarian-inflected Republicanism. During the George W. Bush years, at least at first, differences were muted. But as Bush emerged as a big spenderhis expansion of Medicare to include a prescription drug entitlementconservatives began to openly break with him at CPAC. Were not there with Trump. The enthusiasm for him, the sweep of his ideological shift, the frisson of his surprise victoryall of that means that he goes into his first year in office with extraordinary support from the grassroots that gathers at this Maryland resort even if they were slow to rally to him in the primaries. Now hes their man.If there were non-Trumpian themes from the mainstage at CPAC, I didnt hear them, and even in the smaller breakout sessions, the differences were modest. A panel on trade was more about the road from here than relitigating the now America-free Trans-Pacific Partnership. John Bolton, George W. Bushs hawkish U.N. ambassador who was hoping to land in the Trump administration, had railed on Vladimir Putin during past CPAC conventions. This year he offered only a quick reassurance to the crowd that Trump had been critical of the arms control agreement that Obama had forged with the Russians in 2010. There was no lengthy, frothy denunciation of Moscow.If Bolton has been Trumpified, that doesnt leave much room for the rest of the party. Its worth remembering that Reince Priebus, in his capacity as Republican Party chairman, had offered an autopsy after the 2012 election that said wooing Hispanics was the way forward for the party and that needed to be done with friendly outreach and getting immigration reform settled. Well he was right about one part. It is being settled, but on the terms that Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions come up with.There was lots of talk at CPAC about The Forgotten Mana phrase that Franklin Roosevelt used and that Trump has appropriated. (An eponymous book by a  editorial writer is much touted in GOP circles because it portrayed FDR as the enemy of working folks.) But the forgotten man, presumably a white, working-class voter who felt ignored by both parties, is now center stage. Its axiomatic but true: Its up to Trump and Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to start delivering. So far there have been executive orders and a super conservative cabinet. Next week the president will start to put more flesh on his legislative agenda in a speech before Congress. Will there be serious infrastructure spending or was that rhetoric? After years of dissing Obamacare, will Republicans settle on a replacement plan? Whose taxes will be cut? Will we really start taking care of our vets? The forgotten man is going to start expecting some answers and results.The non-economic issues that animate conservatives were on full display here, and Trump will continue to rile up the base with them. Gun rights, antipathy towardwhat they deem political correctness, a full-throated anger towardfake news, fear of a mixed bathroom. "Facts, Not Feelings: Snowflakes, Safe Spaces and Trigger Warnings" was one of the last panels. In his wildly cheered address here, Trump kept talking about defending the flag, a faint reference to some protesters in 2016. (Never mind that the sainted Justice Antonin Scalia had been the deciding vote striking down a law banning flag burning.) Those issues will continue to percolate but attention is going to turn to the practical lives of the forgotten man. He made Trump and can break him.The White House has rejected an intelligence report that undermines President Donald Trump's rationale for his halted travel ban from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that the report's quality is subpar.The report from the Department of Homeland Security did not find significant domestic terror threats from the nations that were included in the banSyria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudanand concluded that "country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity," . The unclassified report is based on public statistics as well as reports from intelligence agencies, the Department of Justice and the State Department, but the White House believes it is incomplete.The president asked for an intelligence assessment. This is not the intelligence assessment the president asked for, a senior administration official told the . However, Homeland Security spokesperson Gillian M. Christensen also criticized the report, calling it "an incomplete product that fails to find evidence of terrorism by simply refusing to look at all the available evidence."The Trump team has promised a revised travel and refugee ban after its initial executive order was blockedby the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after days of confusion and detentions at the nation's airports. The president repeatedly blasted the ruling as political but the administration has thus far declined to contest it in court, preferring to draft a new temporary travel and refugee ban that addresses the Constitutional questions cited by the Ninth Circuit. The new executive order is reportedly complete and could be issued in the coming days.Trump and the Department of Justice had argued that the order was necessary to preserve national security, an argument that the Ninth Circuit found fault with. The rejected DHS report doesn't add much credence to that argument, with only two of the seven countries in Trump's order making the list of the top countries for individuals engaged in terror activities in the U.S. Instead, the top seven countries that could be said to pose a general terror threat within the continental U.S. arePakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iraq and Uzbekistan, the The DHS report said that foreigners inspired to participate in terror in the U.S. came from 26 countries in the past six years, with "slightly more than half" of individuals who had died in terror-related acts or were imprisoned were native-born citizens, the
