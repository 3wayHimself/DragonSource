The Labour leader says he is determined to "finish the job" of reconnecting the party with working class voters and values.Jeremy Corbyn is claiming he can "turn back the Tory tide" despite a new opinion poll suggesting Labour would perform much better with a new leader.After Labour was swept away by the Conservatives in Copeland, Mr Corbyn will attempt to fight back in a speech at the Scottish Labour conference in Perth.Ahead of his speech, the embattled Labour leader says he takes his share of responsibility for Copeland - but blames globalisation and a rigged economy."We haven't done enough yet to rebuild trust with people who have been ripped off and sold out for decades and don't feel Labour represents them," he wrote in the Sunday Mirror.Defiantly rejecting calls to step down, he added: "I was re-elected Labour leader five months ago with a bigger majority and I am determined to finish that job: to reconnect Labour with our working class voters and values - so we can win power to rebuild and transform Britain, for the many, not just the few."The poll suggests the most popular alternative leader to Mr Corbyn would be London mayor Sadiq Khan, who was given a rousing reception by Labour activists at the Scottish conference in Perth.More than 100 miles south of Copeland, in Wigan - solidly Labour since 1918 - Sky News found that Mr Corbyn divides opinion among voters."He's got the true values of working class people," said one man. "I think the Parliamentary Labour Party should get behind him."But one female voter said: "I just don't like him - don't know what the word is - I think he lies a bit."And another woman said: "I don't think any of them know what's best for us at the moment. It'll have to be wait and see and hope for the best."Wigan's MP, Lisa Nandy, speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, says it's no good Mr Corbyn blaming globalisation and a rigged economy for results like Copeland."The trouble with looking at every factor apart from Labour is that it's just a thoroughly inadequate response," she told Sky News."If we really want to address what has been happening to the Labour Party for a very long time, then we as a party need to get out of our comfort zone and start confronting some of the very difficult issues we face."Asked by Sophy if she gave Mr Corbyn a year to turn things around, the MP said: "That's what his close team said, that they're determined to do that within a year - and I think that's absolutely critical.The US President breaks with tradition - a day after he renewed his attack on the media by calling it "the enemy of the people".

Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!The annual dinner is a light-hearted roast held by journalists and attended by celebrities. This year it is held on 29 April in Washington.Some news outlets such as Bloomberg News and The New Yorker, which usually host lavish after-parties, had already backed out this year.The dinner "has been and will continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic," said Jeff Mason, a Reuters White House correspondent who heads the association this year.Reporters for CNN, The New York Times, Politico, The Los Angeles Times and BuzzFeed were not allowed into the session in the office of press secretary Sean Spicer, a decision that drew strong protests and led some to boycott the briefing.Police say they have found no trace of the nerve agent that was suspected to have killed Kim Jong-Un's half-brother.Police have completed a "forensic sweep" of one of the terminals at Kuala Lumpur airportwhere the exiled half-brother of North Korea's leader was poisoned and killed.Malaysian officials declared it safe after completing the operation to check for possible traces of a toxic nerve agent suspected to have been used in the attack on Kim Jong-Nam.The two-hour sweep involved officers from the police's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear teams, as well as the fire department's hazardous materials unit and the government's atomic energy board.Senior police official Abdul Samah Mat, who is leading the investigation, declared the terminal a "safe zone" after the no hazardous material was detected.Officials had previously insisted the airport - which has seen tens of thousands of passengers pass through since the attack nearly two weeks ago - was safe.No areas had been cordoned off or protective measures put in place, although officials have said the footsteps of the suspects' were being traced in order to "ensure public safety".Health minister Subramaniam Sathasivam said on Sunday that post mortem results suggested that the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent caused "very serious paralysis" that led to Mr Kim's death.Meanwhile, one of the female suspects arrested for the murder claimed she was paid the equivalent of 72 to carry out what she believed was a "prank".Indonesian national Siti Aisyah said she had been handed 400 Malaysian ringgits to smear an oily substance - similar to baby oil - onto Mr Kim's face.The 25-year-old suspect also said she did not want her parents to see her in custody as she did not want them to be "sad" and was worried about their health.A 28-year-old Vietnamese woman - who said she believed she was "starring in some sort of comedy video" - and a North Korean man have also been arrested.Police are currently hunting for further suspects, including four North Korean men who they believe provided the women with poison before fleeing the country.Malaysian officials have also warned they will issue an arrest warrant for North Korean diplomat Hyon Kwang Song if he refused to cooperate with the investigation.They had previously acknowledged his right to diplomatic immunity, which meant he could not be forced to attend questioning.Twelve people have been badly hurt after a car ploughed into crowds attending a parade in the US city of New Orleans.The crash was reported at about 6.45pm local time - and a New Orleans Police Department spokeswoman said "initial reports show so far that about a dozen people are in a critical condition".Kourtney McKinnis, who was attending the Krewe of Endymion parade, told the New Orleans Advocate that the driver seemed almost unaware of what he had done in the aftermath of the crash.Police say one person has been taken into custody following the crash, but investigators are not treating it as a terrorist incident.Meryl Streep set the tone for assaults on Donald Trump at the Golden Globes, but some actors say these protests are inappropriate.The head of the Academy Awards has told Sky News she supports stars who make political statements from the Oscars stage.Hollywood's biggest night is set to be dominated by the spectre of the controversial presidency of Donald Trump.And Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs told Sky News she will not condemn stars who use the Oscars platform to make political points."It makes it very human, I think, because it is of the moment and no one knows what name is going to be read off the envelope so it pretty spontaneous."I think and I hope that those on stage will give 45 seconds of something really meaningful and touching."Meryl Streep set the tone for awards season assaults on Mr Trump with her condemnation of the president at the Golden Globes. He responded by calling her overrated.A major Hollywood talent agency cancelled its traditional pre-Oscars party and instead held a "unity" rally to raise money for the American Civil Liberties Union. Stars including Jodie Foster appeared on stage in front of 1,200-strong crowd in Beverly Hills.British-American star Andrew Garfield, nominated for best actor for his performance in Hacksaw Ridge, said: "Unfortunately celebrity culture has got to the point where a celebrity's voice is more meaningful than other people's in certain ways."That it is a shame and shouldn't be the case. I am not a big fan of that as a cultural state that we're in."The Oscars have seen political protests before. In 1973, Marlon Brando boycotted his award for The Godfather over the treatment of Native Americans by Hollywood.Director Michael Moore was booed off stage in 2003 for criticising George W Bush, who was president at the time.The debate about politics and Donald Trump has replaced the controversy over diversity at the Oscars, which has dominated discussion in recent years.Brian McLaughlin, a film producer and instructor at the LA film school, said: "These folks have given us countless hours of entertainment. For us to give them 30 seconds to speak on an important issue, I think, is a fair trade and good for democracy."The Tory peer says the Supreme Court's ruling that MPs and peers have ultimate authority over Brexit must be upheld.Theresa May is facing a rebellion in the House of Lords - with Tory grandee Michael Heseltine vowing to defy the Prime Minister and back opposition efforts to ensure Parliament gets a meaningful vote on the final outcome of Brexit negotiations.Lord Heseltine said Labour, Lib Dem and rebellious Conservative colleagues are prepared to throw their support behind a change to the Government's Brexit Bill.They want Parliament to have the ability to veto the outcome of Mrs May's negotiations in Brussels, including if she walks away without a deal.Writing for The Mail on Sunday, Lord Heseltine said he was not engaging in a "confrontation" with the Government - but warned the Supreme Court's ruling that MPs and peers have ultimate authority over Brexit needs to be upheld."It will also have to pass in 27 national European parliaments, several sub-national parliaments and the European Parliament."It was perhaps unwise for our Government to suppose that our Parliament should be excluded where all others were included."Senior ministers have vowed to thwart Lord Heseltine's rebellion - telling the newspaper that he and his supporters as "bad losers who are trying to wreck Brexit".Sky's Chief Political Correspondent Jon Craig said Lord Heseltine's decision to lead the charge against Article 50 will be a "rallying call to the rebels".He explained: "They want more votes before a Brexit deal happens and also protection for EU citizens living in this country."It is a headache that Theresa May could do without as she is celebrating a good by-election result in Copeland."A man drives his car into a group of people standing near a bakery in Heidelberg, before he is tracked down by police and shot.One person has died after a man drove a car into people in a central square in the German city of Heidelberg.The suspect's motives were not immediately clear but police said there were no signs that it was a terrorist attack.He was seen getting out of the car with a knife, and was later tracked down near a swimming pool.

We're appealing to people to stay away and not go out in boats."The warning was echoed by the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, which said any boating traffic could frighten the whale into making a mistake and beaching, or swimming into areas where it could become entangled in fishing gear.Stephen Marsh, the charity's Operations Manager, said: "We would ask members of the public to stay away from this beautiful animal to allow it to feed naturally and not be shocked into stranding."Disturbing a whale, dolphin or porpoise is illegal in the UK and so authorities have been recording any human activity surrounding this whale and will be looking for infringements of the law."It's quite possible to see the whale from the shore and therefore there is no need to enter the water to approach it."Jade Dunne is released on bail to appear at magistrates' court after Dexter Neal died at her home in August last year.A woman has been charged with owning a dangerously out of control dog following the death of a three-year-old boy in August 2016.Jade Dunne, 29, of Parker Way, Halstead, has been released on bail to appear at Colchester Magistrates' Court on 27 March.Writing on Facebook at the time, Ashley Coe described Dexter as his "darling nephew", adding: "I can't even begin to describe what state we are all in."This is an absolutely devastating loss for my sister and her husband and there's nothing I can say to them."Witnesses said at the time they heard screaming at around 5.45pm on the day the incident is alleged to have happened."Now I know what the scream was, it is absolutely awful," one said, adding: "It was like someone was in pain, definitely - agonising screams."
