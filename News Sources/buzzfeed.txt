Ill have to tell you the unofficial story of how Diego and I met, because its what Ive been told by my parents since I was too young to remember. I met him when he was two days old and I was about one and my mother took me to visit him in the Mexican hospital where he was born. I think I ended up poking him in the face.We spent a lot of time together as babies but my father remembers the first time that Diego and I really became friends. We were walking with our parents in this beautiful plaza near our homes when we bumped into each other. Diego and I greeted each other and started to play and then  being little boys  fight. Since then weve have spent most of our lives hanging out together.Starting soon, you'll only be able to post a comment on BuzzFeed using a Facebook account or via our app. If you have questions or thoughts, Sadly, an error occured while sending your feedback.

    				Theres a LOT more to it than just liposuction and boob jobs.
    				
    				
    			, where we take lavish vacations, wear high-end clothing, and live super-luxurious lives. However, yes, we do make a lot of money and that is an appeal of going into the field.Some people have dropped a significant amount of weight and want to get an abdominoplasty  or tummy tuck  to take care of the excess skin. Some have experienced changes to their breasts after pregnancy, breastfeeding, or cancer, and they just want their breasts to look the same again. Not all operations are necessary to live, but they may restore peoples confidence and self-esteem.The perceptions that plastic surgeons tend to be interested in the way they look is probably true for many in the field. In the same vein that its hard to find a fashion designer who doesnt care about what they wear, its pretty hard to find a plastic surgeon who isnt neat, or healthy, or doesnt care about their presentation.Once you get to med school, you realize how many specializations there really are. Theres hand surgery, pediatric plastic surgery (for birth defects such as cleft lips), cosmetic surgery, peripheral nerve surgery, microsurgery, and general plastic surgery, which involves a mix of a lot of these things. Theres a lot more to plastic surgery than what people see in movies and TV shows.Most surgeons in other fields have limits on who they can operate on and where. But plastic surgeons are able to operate on anyone at any age, including children.We wish the public had a better understanding of the tons of requirements it takes to get board certifications, how many years of education that entails, and the amount of serious medical decision-making that goes into everything that you do., or cosmetic, plastic surgery is when someone wants to change something about their appearance. This includes things like tummy tucks, liposuction, butt lifts, etc. plastic surgery is for people who, for instance, have birth defects, have been in accidents (car crashes, fire injuries, etc.), or have gone through surgeries for other health reasons and arent happy with the results of their operations. One of the most common reasons for reconstructive surgery is repairing skin cancer damage to the face, nose, and ears.If you think about it, how many different types of noses, eyes, lips, etc., do you see a day? There are so many different ways to do every single plastic surgery, and thats one of the coolest things about our field.Some people say that all orthopedists are former jocks or people who just love sports. The stereotype for plastic surgeons is that we all have an appreciation for art. Most of us do have a strong background in an artistic hobby.You have to look at our previous work and see if you like our aesthetic, because every single operation can be done differently depending on the plastic surgeon. Its like scrolling through a tattoo artists Instagram or checking out the art books in their studio. We have photo galleries on our websites and in our offices that showcase the work weve done so people can see if it matches what theyre looking for.We have to make sure that what a patient wants and desires is in line with what we can give them. Sometimes what people want isnt aligned with reality, it isnt safe, it isnt healthy, or it isnt worth the risk. There are some people we will not operate on no matter what kind of money theyre willing to pay.In most cases we have a good idea of how long a procedure is going to take, but we usually leave some cushion time for experimentation because we know were perfectionists. In the case of breast augmentations, we may try different-sized and different-shaped implants to see what they look like before choosing the final one.For some practices, the average patients income is around $50,000 a year. Most procedures are not incredibly expensive and can be easy to save for if you really want or need it.Every day can be different. Depending on the week, we might wake up really early to meet with patients, maybe attend conferences, and then be back in the operating room by the afternoon to do a breast reconstruction, an augmentation, or a rhinoplasty (nose job), and then have to see a bunch of patients afterward.One of the best things about being a plastic surgeon is the various types of interactions you get to have with different people. Sometimes when we walk into a breast augmentation consultation, weve just come from helping a kid who got his finger stuck in a door at school.Most liposuction patients are already in good shape; they just want help with specific areas where they have trouble losing weight.Sometimes we try to avoid telling people what we do because we dont want them to come up to us and ask what we can do for them. Its just an awkward situation that isnt comfortable for us. We dont want to tell people that they wouldnt be a good candidate, or judge their bodies and potentially hurt their feelings, so there are times when we try to avoid talking about it altogether.People sometimes expect us to do consultations on the spot, but its really uncomfortable and the last thing we want to do during our off hours, while were on vacation, spending time with our family, or just enjoying downtime.If you cut corners, youre going to get the service that you pay for. Maybe the place that offers heavy discounts doesnt use a board-certified anesthesiologist or board-certified nurses. People can get infections from these procedures and they can die. Its not worth it.. But every now and then well think about what procedures we could do for people. Its a part of what we do for a living every day, so sometimes it can be hard to turn off.We are lucky in that we usually dont have as many emergency surgeries come up, but we do work long hours. And there are some operations that can be especially time-consuming, like a specific type of breast reconstruction that requires transplanting other tissue to the breast.When we take care of these patients, were usually involved in their lives for a long period of time  sometimes years. So we can form very special bond with them and end up keeping in touch.We usually work with patients who tend to be healthy and have outcomes that theyre happy with. Its not very often that we have to share bad news, so it can be a really fulfilling field. For the most part, were doing operations that people want, and that will make them look and feel more confident.Starting soon, you'll only be able to post a comment on BuzzFeed using a Facebook account or via our app. If you have questions or thoughts, Sadly, an error occured while sending your feedback.

Denis had originally dug trenches around his backyard to stop Wally from jumping over the fence, but it also gave Wally and his short legs a way to exercise. His favourite thing is to push his Jolly Egg toy around the maze, giving him a chance to use his herding instincts on something other than the Jalberts cats.Starting soon, you'll only be able to post a comment on BuzzFeed using a Facebook account or via our app. If you have questions or thoughts, Sadly, an error occured while sending your feedback.

    			OLeary, who is seeking the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada, was asked about the incident after a candidates debate held at the Manning Conference in Ottawa., entrepreneur Nora Furber sought investment in her company, Monjeloco Jeans, which sells jeans designed to provide round bums.Asked by a reporter whether he had gotten permission to do so, OLeary said on Friday that he couldnt remember, and that there was a lot of footage of him as an entertainer on television that was not pertinent to his political career. OLeary and the other dragons on the show did not ultimately invest in the company, despite expressing enthusiasm for the product. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Monjeloco Jeans for comment.Sadly, an error occured while sending your feedback. Please contact bugs@buzzfeed.com

    				This week: Lipstick holders, puppy socks, and kitchen gadgets!
    				
    				
    			 So cute! You get a different puppy face on each pair. The puppy faces are face outwards from the heel and back of your legs and I love the way the cute little ears poke out at the top. Promising review: Awesome product! This makes organising your lipsticks a breeze and looks beautiful too.  Excellent! It easily rolls up for storage and feels very smooth. The measurements really help guide you.  I started out with the set of ten of these pens, and loved them. The only thing I was sad about was the fact that there werent as many colours as I wanted. Then this pack came out, and I was very excited. They have small nibs, which is perfect for getting into the tiny spaces in my colouring books. They are bright and vibrant and I love that there are neon colours in this pack too!  Im not even halfway through this book even, but I like what Ive read so far. Its incredibly insightful and the philosophy within the book certainly sounds like it holds water. Plus, its pretty funny at times! Promising review: Great product! Weve used it for the past few weeks and its been awesome! The automatic setting is great.  These cookie cutters are such a hoot! The decorating ideas are endless but they are so attractive. The cutters are very sturdy and so unique. I just adore these cookies!  I have three boys who are always on the run and these cup covers help me keep the house clean! They fit all my cups and are truly amazing!  This was easy to install and looks way better than a regular pet flap. Ive had so many people comment on how cute it is and my cat now has easy access to the basement (and his litter box) without us having to leave the door open!

                                 to let us know.Fluorescent cheese powder is OK, but microwaving the noodles? Cmon. Either they come out completely mushy or theres like 15 noodles that didnt get submerged in the water that tastes like the plastic thing at end of a shoestring.We dont want tomatoes. That is a vegetable. What we really want is ketchup and well add it ourselves. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.This is OK but somehow the cheese powder tastes, even more, powder-y? Like grainy? I guess thats what they mean by sharp.Stop trying to ~elevate~ the dish. ITS ALREADY SEASONED WITH MYSTERIOUS INGREDIENTS. Just let it live, OK?! If youre one of those people who boil their hot dogs in a pot and then proceed to COOK THE NOODLES IN THE GROSS HOT DOG WATER, please reevaluate your life choices.Starting soon, you'll only be able to post a comment on BuzzFeed using a Facebook account or via our app. If you have questions or thoughts, Sadly, an error occured while sending your feedback.
