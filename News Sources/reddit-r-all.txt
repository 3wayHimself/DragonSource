"I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!" Trump tweeted on Saturday afternoon.I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! and several other major media outlets were blocked from attending a Friday White House press briefing. The president also continued to express his dislike for "fake news" media and targeted reporters' use of anonymous sources while White House Correspondents' Association president Jeff Mason said in a statement that the group has noted Trump's announcement and is still looking forward to the April 29 dinner, "which has been and will continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic."We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession," the statement concludes. their annual party in celebration of the dinner. The business outlet usually co-hosts the event with Conde Nast's at the Willard Hotel in the nation's capital, raising funds to support the Committee to Protect Journalists.A host has yet to be named for the Correspondents' dinner. Stephen Colbert, however, said he would be "honored" to take the stage, and Trevor Noah Trump's decision is historical as it's been a longtime tradition that the president make an appearance at the dinner. He will be the first president to skip the dinner since Ronald Reagan in 1981, who missed the dinner while recovering from an assassination attempt, but still delivered remarks over the phone.American Pharoah has begun living the fantasy life of a blossoming male teenager. He lives and roams luxuriously. He eats and sleeps a ton. And hell have sex up to three times a day.They enjoy it quite a bit, said Stewart Fitzgibbon, commercial manager at Castleton Lyons farm in Lexington, Ky. And its not hard to see why.The Triple Crown winner ran three more races last year before retiring to a life lavish life of fornication and relaxation. His breeding rights were sold to Coolmore Stud for an undisclosed amount in 2014. He now commands $200,000 per cover (impregnation), and , has taken to his new career with the same drive and skill as he did on the race track. He should make about $30 million for Coolmore this year alone and has already has success in the breeding shed with an 80 percent "strike rate."Tapit finished ninth in the 2004 Kentucky Derby and now garners a stud fee of $300,000, the highest in the United States. It started at $15,000 in 2005 but since his offspring have had so much success on the track, its risen incrementallyover the last decade, said Michael Hernon, director of sales at Gainesway Farm,where Tapit stands.These stallionsquickly learn their new responsibilities. When Tapitleaves his wide, comfortable stall, there are two possible destinations  the paddock or the breeding shed, the latter morelikely around 9 a.m., 1 p.m. or 6 p.m.Many of the biggest breeding farms are located in a 40-mile radius in Kentucky, so the best personnel  from groomers to vets to the horses themselves  are close by. Breeding season runs from February to July because the heat helps female fertility. Itslows down in June, so thoroughbreds enjoy a four- or five-month sex romp with a whole lot of food to meet energy demands.The breeding sessions take just a few minutes. A group of supervisors lead the stallion to the mare (female)in the shedto make sure the deed gets done. They thenexaminea small semen sample to make sure it willswimadequately.Beforehand and afterward, theres no room for cuddling,foreplay or breakfast. A stallion gets in and gets out.Horses doneed a break from all that unemotional sex, so for half the year, they don't breed at all.DavidIngordo, a bloodstock agent for Lanes End Farm who advisedZayatto buy back AmericanPharoahin 2013, said it's critical horses get a break  over breeding can lead to back problems."It's strenuous activity," he said. "So for half the year, they get to roll around in the dirt, lay in the grass, and just basically play."Most racehorses are never ridden again once they retire to stud. They get exercise in their several-acre paddocks by running on their own. They're born and bred to run, so it comes natural, Ingordo said. But per the Times, Thunder Gulch, the 1995 Derby and Belmont winner, has taught American Pharoah how to live a more laid-back life. New studs love to run free, but not the 24-year-old Thunder Gulch.Food and sex for half the year and bumming around for the other? Doesn't sound so bad. The teams at their farms never stop working, though.Throughout the fall, management at various farmslooks into possible matches with mares and works on acquiring new stallions. They look at four things  pedigree, performance, physical makeup and price. Its like any other market, socost will rise and fall based on demand."It's a form of handicapping, like at the track. It's a similar sort of process," said Glenye CainOakford, an author and bloodstock business correspondent for Bloodhorse.com. "Farms take calculated risks buying horses and paying stud fees for their mares. It's a form of high-stakes gambling."In the fall, stallions are booked for the spring, but not necessarily on specific dates.Breedersonlypay the stud fee when the mares produce a foal that can stand on its own 11 months later.Last year, Tapit sired about130 foals, Hernon said. This year, with a stud fee of $300,000, he could net nearly $40 million.Once breeding season begins, mares are closely monitored by their veterinarians. They look at ovulation cycles and forecast what day would be best for impregnation. The stallions, on the other hand, just do their thing, day in and day out.It will be a few years before any of American Pharoah's children are in action. Horses begin training and racing as two-year-olds, but hisfoals wont even be born until early in 2017. They'll be yearlings  the most common time to be sold  in 2018, and will begin running in 2019. They could hit the Triple Crown circuit in 2020.Ingordo said American Pharoah'svalue has a built-in floor because he won the Triple Crown, and not much can change that.Even so, there's no guarantee American Pharoahever produces big-time race horses.Regardless,AmericanPharoahstands in Versailles, Ky., whereCoolmoremanagement hopes hell breed the next Triple Crown winner, or at the very least, some graded Stakes victors.Oakford said Coolmoreknew exactly what it was doing last year when it bought the breeding rights for American Pharoah before he had even become 2-year-old champion.Although it's a high-stakes gamble, it's one that should pay off."(The Triple Crown) is the ultimate accolade," Fitzgibbon said. "Plenty of horses have tried in 37 years and only one succeeded. It has to mean good things."The ability to earn his employer millions of dollars just by having sex and rolling around in the dirt is well-deserved for a race horse that captured America's heart with its first Triple Crown since 1978.In an early morning tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump echoed a post on a fringe website claiming that the national debt has decreased by $12 billion since Trump took office."The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.," Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017.The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trumps tweet."On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion," the Gateway Pundit website reads. "On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the But, experts say, people shouldnt read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne."Considering that Trump hasnt enacted any fiscal legislation, its a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels," Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us."Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns," he said.Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is "debts held by the public," which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else.On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion.So, in isolation, the debt held by the public is down since Trump took office. But experts say its likely to shoot back up any day."I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about," said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel."This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future?"Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, "both matters that he has not affected one iota.""No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all.There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number."Donald Marron, Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute,speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obamas administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently.Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is "down" after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise.This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure.The Gateway Pundit, Amazing! Trump Cuts US Debt by $12 Billion In His First Month  UPDATE: Trump Tweets Our Numbers, Feb. 23.

again.Super sweet!! I have 4 kids and he is so gentle with them.. we thought he was beige until we got him a bath and realized he was all white! According to the vet he is about 25 lbs under weight now and will probably put on 30 more after that.. I don't know why anyone would give up this loving puppyHonestly I only have my mobile.. is there a way I can post pics from here? I have the one I took before he got washed!Yup! Imgur is available on Google Play and iTunes. After that you can copy the upload link and paste here.great pyreneese mutt? if thats the case he will be fantastic with the kids, but theyre pyrs are genetic guard dogs. its instinctual they cant help it. may be a barker. ive got a great pyr now and theyre the best dogs. such personalities! my last dog was a 8yo rescue who was half great pyr half collie(we think) he was the best dog i have ever, and will ever own.I have one, and she's amazingly gentle and loving. She's also constantly on guard, and she gets lots of exercise running around our property. If you don't have much space, you should consider taking your pup to an off-leash park regularly.my only complaint with my big guy now, is he WONT SHUT UP! all he does is bark. ohh look i think i saw a leaf blow down the driveway BARK!...i think i heard something BARK! its actually kind of funny. he was super quiet as a puppy and a "teenager" but one day he realized he had this ridiculously deep voice and hasnt shut up about it since.i tell you what though, we used to have a lot of coyotes in the neighborhood before we got the beast. i havent seen any around my house since he fully matured.course all his family for a few generations were working dogs on a farm guarding the livestock, so i dont know if that has something to do with it as opposed to getting the dog from a pet breeder.That's so interesting. Shiba, my friend's pyrenees would bark at the train for some reason in the middle of the night. She is also terrified of thunderstorms. She cannot stay in one place and she cries while there are some thunderstorms.  I feel so sad when that happens. I just adopted a great pyr/collie mix and she is amazing so far! I'm glad to see this appears to be a trend :)Are pyraneese Barker's? Our vet said our lab mutt may have Pyr in him because he has two back du claws, and this pupper barks like mad. He's been protective of our home since we adopted him at 9 weeks.good lord my dog barks, he barks at everything(rarely in the house though) but he only started barking when his voice was fully matured. so i had a few months of peace and quite.Yeah... you're going to have to post more pictures.  This isn't going to cut it for us.  He's too cute.Sorry to be the party pooper and I'm sure you're taking necessary precautions, but be very careful with the kids (teach them to be very respectful and gentle and keep a constant eye on the dog) until you know the dog much better. I've fostered many dogs and have come to realize that these beautiful creatures can sometimes have unexpected reactions, especially while they're adjusting to their new lives. When we adopted our basset hound mutt, she was scrawny and underweight. A bar-s wiener every day until she fattened up took care of that. Looks like a relaxed and grateful dog.I judge bad owners greatly, but life changes sadly and sometimes you have to make terrible decisions.Oh my god this looks like my dog Einstein. I had to get rid of him becuase my parents were getting divorced and we were moving. Did you happen to adopt him in southern indiana?Do you mean breed? And why is it bad to select a breed that typically has personality traits suited to your lifestyle?I just wanna mush those paws! My dogs foot paws are ticklish, and he moves and protects then when I tickle them. But his front paws aren't and you can give him a little massage and give him paw kisses. Is it safe to kiss your dog's paws like that? Can you get sick? Puppers walk through who knows what. It's probably safe, just like it's relatively safe to eat things off the floor and to drink toilet water. If it wasn't, I'm sure you'd get bacteria from dog's feet on your couch, touch your couch, touch your mouth, then get sick.Since (I believe) that doesn't happen, I'm assuming it's safe. I kiss my kitty's paws and lips all the time and I haven't gotten sick yet.Alright I'm drawing the line at kitten paws, you ever think about the fact that they tromp around the litter box a few times a day?Yeah. Doesn't bother me. It's not like I'm getting globs of shit on me, and I usually only kiss the tops of her paws, anyways. Yeah unless I see or know my pets rolled/walked in something nasty I kiss to my hearts content. Boosts my immune system I'm sure. Ew. I wouldn't. There are reasons that humans wear shoes. Like hookworm. And ringworm. And some soils have some nasty bacteria. Great PyrX?  Beautiful dog.  If he is what I think he is, he is going to be a great guardian for the kids.  He's also going to be a strapping lad, though, and he is going to tear that chair to shreds. Get him a dog bed.  He will love having his own personal piece of furniture and you will love having that amazing chair for years to come.He looks totally relaxed and relieved to be finally home.  Good for you OP.  Great addition to the family. I'm usually talking in pupper terminology, but seriously.... imagine the trauma and confusion of being in a situation like that. Not being in a cage, or alone, or in the mix with so many angry or unhappy or sad dogs.... and finding it quiet, and warm, and comfy. It breaks my heart and I can only adopt a few dogs at a time, but I want to make a hotel where it's a farm that you stay at and meet a bunch of rescues, and get to leave with one.It's so sweet of you to adopt such a couch. The fact that your dog is welcoming it just shows how at home the counch is going to feel in the future. Good for you.That little woofer is going to be HUGE once he gets some decent food in his tum tum! Congratulations on saving such a wonderful animal! Be sure to spoil him with plenty of treats and table scraps Ps. Uff Uff Woof Woof!When my family adopted our cat he was the sleepiest most cuddly kitty I've ever seen for a few days, then become a pretty normal cat. Is there something about coming out of the shelter that makes animals cuddlier and sleepier?I'd imagine for a lot of them being in a shelter can be quite stressful, so getting to their new home is a chance to actually relax.It's exhausting finding your forever home! There's paper work, and car rides, then petco, then play time, then exploring, then walkies, then more play time, and by the end of the day you are ready for sleepies!Looks like someone lost their rights to sitting in that chair for quite some time now that doggo has claimed it.Sweet doggo. Lots of runs and love and good food to you, from my rescue. Remember your human mustn't leave you alone for more than four hours at a time. Big hugs. You better tell him he's a good boy every day!!!! He seems like he's been through a lot, and that couch is the most comfortable thing he's experienced in a while, good for you!:)awh, little sleepy baby! My doggy is all white and dogs like ours are the prettiest of them all. I might be a little biased but I'm defintley not wrong! haha so glad to see a happy rescue in a loving furever home.Thank you for choosing to adopt.  There are plenty of great let's that are just waiting for a good home.Nice doggy OP! He has a happy grin while sleeping. Dreaming of a good life with new people. Congrats!And you haven't gotten him a blanket? You monster! JK. I'm sure he'll thank you every day for adopting him.Serious question here. I love my dogs but they stay outside no matter what. How can you deal with the dog hair, dog poop and pee, ect. from having a mess inside? You would have to clean constantly with no end. And then live with all that dog hair in your couches, clothes, floor ect. Well first off you house train your dog to not make a mess indoors. As for the hair and stuff, you vacuum? My dog (a golden retriever) isn't allowed on furniture, so that isn't an issue, and as for the carpets, if you brush your dog properly once a week, it won't shed too much. I only have to vacuum once a week on average, and that is with a dark carpet that would really show the hair.Well hair is just going to happen so you vaccuum. As for pee and poop you house train them to only go outside. They are smart and pick it up quick. Accidents will happen though but all the hugs and hyjinx are worth it.
