After we fought so hard to put the Commons back at the centre of the debate, all the Commons did was rubber stamp the Bill  which was cowardice.I am hoping the Lords actually do what they should be doing constitutionally  exercising their parliamentary sovereignty, being independent, scrutinising the Government and looking to put in amendments.Ms Miller is no stranger to media pressure, having received a torrent of abuse for leading the charge against the Government in the Supreme Court case on Brexit.She said peers are now being picked off and bullied by elements of the media into abandoning their constitutional duty to scrutinise Ms Mays Bill, adding that the Prime Minister has also sought to intimidate the upper House. Discussing Ms Mays appearance in the Lords as it debated the matter, Ms Miller said: She was sitting there like Miss Trunchbull from The only conclusion I can come to is that she was trying to bully them. Why else would you be there?In Dahls classic story, sadistic head-teacher Miss Trunchbull, whose motto is use the rod, beat the child, eventually comes a cropper when she pushes the wrong schoolgirl too far.Ms Miller is particularly keen to see an amendment passed in the Lords which forces Ms May into guaranteeing that Parliament has a meaningful vote on the final deal she secures after talks in Europe.That does not mean simply a choice between leaving the EU on Ms Mays terms or leaving without a new trade deal with the EU, as Ms Miller explained: A choice between shooting yourself in the foot with an arrow or a pistol is not a choice.Instead she wants all the options to be on the table. A drive in the Commons to see the promise of a vote on the final deal written into the Bill was dropped, after the Government gave a verbal assurance to MPs that a vote would happen.But Ms Miller said a political promise is worth nothing, adding: They should be amending it. These people who are standing up and constantly claiming that amendments are going against the will of the people are wrong, its got nothing to do with that.This is about triggering Article 50, going forward and putting in some safety valve if its needed in the future we have to an opportunity where Parliament is able to vote on all options  that amendment is absolutely crucial.demanding the British people are given the chance tohave their say on Ms May's Brexit deal, through a vote in Parliament or even a referendum. Peershave proposed a string of amendments to Ms Mays bill, some of which have cross-party support. Whether they are pushed to a vote in the coming week will be down to how reasonable the Government is at taking on board peers concerns.It may be that ministers go away promising to rewrite the bill to account for some of the concerns raised, thus putting off the threat of a vote and defeat in the Lords to a later stage in the process.Labour insiders believe that the Government may be ready to try and compromise on the issue of vote on Ms Mays final deal and so the issue mightavoida vote this week.If a vote doesoccur, it is most likely to be on the amendment to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, which enjoys support from every part of the Lords. In the instance that the Lords does vote to amend the Bill, those changes would then have to go back to the Commons for approval.Downing Street has said it still expects to meet its goal of finishing the legislative process around the Bill and triggering Article 50 by the end of March.Advertising helps fund our journalism and keep it truly independent.

Read our Labours deputy Leader has said things have to change in the wake of the partys devastating by-election defeat in Copeland.Tom Watson reminded his party it must win 100 seats at the next election to overthrow the Tories and that holding on to constituencies like Copeland should be the easy bit.He demanded Labour reconnect with its natural voters and pursue a broad agenda that could unite people from different backgrounds, including those who create prosperity.While the Deputy Leader said it was not the time for another leadership election, his words will be read by some as a criticism of the approach adopted by Jeremy Corbyn up to now.Labours shocking by-election loss to the Tories in Copeland, the first time an opposition party has lost a by-election to a governing party in decades, left one member of Mr Corbyns own frontbench admitting the result would deliver Seeking to regain the initiative in the wake of the result, Mr Watson said: Im hugely disappointed that Gillian Troughton wont be joining [Labour] in Parliament as the MP for Copeland.That means that all of us with leadership roles in the Labour Party need to have a long, hard look at ourselves and whats not working. Seven years into a Tory government, we shouldnt be facing questions about whether we can retain the seats we already hold.Our job at the next election is to gain over 100 seats. Keeping what we have is supposed to be the easy bit.While stating that the issue of the leadership was settled last year, he added: We have to do better. We cannot sustain this level of distance from the electorate, from our natural supporters. So things have to change.He cited one of the latest opinion polls suggesting Labour is five and half million votes behind Theresa Mays Tories.Apparently taking on claims by Mr Corbyns supporters that Labour is progressing because of the size of its membership, Mr Watson said: We pride ourselves on being the biggest mass-membership political party in Europe, with more than half a million members. Thats great.We've won in our own right before by appealing across the country, to Tories and SNP voters  to Lib Dems, UKIP supporters and Greens. By persuading them to change their minds and switch their votes.Mr Watson argued that the party had to make it clear that it is on the side of people who create prosperity as well as those who need job security, before later repeating that Labour should be unafraid to talk about prosperity, and about supporting business.He also pointed to greater devolution to regions and cities as a way that the party could reach a unified approach to Brexit, whilst making demands of Ms May as she secures a deal to take the UK out of Europe.But he dismissed the idea of forming a progressive alliance with other parties claiming that it is an electoral dead end. on Saturday, Mr Miliband said he is deeply concerned over Labour's future. Asked whether he would consider a comeback, he added: I honestly don't know what I'm going to do. It's hard to see, but what's the point of saying never?MPs have warned the party is on course for a catastrophic general election defeat, after the Conservatives snatched the Cumbrian seat of Copeland which had been held by Labour since 1935.Advertising helps fund our journalism and keep it truly independent.

However, he was hit in the hand and chest, the bullet narrowly missing an artery.The strong xenophobic overtones of the attack have raised concern at an anti-immigrant atmosphere in the US, which critics say is linked to President Donald Trumps America First stance.A recent attempt to ban entry into the US from seven Muslim majority countries was blocked in the courts but was met with approval from sections of Mr Trumps key support base.We've read many times in newspapers of some kind of shooting happening everywhere, Sunayana Dumala told a press conference.I was always concerned: 'Are we doing the right thing staying in the United States of America?'
