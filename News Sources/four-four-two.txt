Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte heaped praise on Cesc Fabregas after the midfielder celebrated his 300th Premier League appearance with a goal.Spain international Fabregas enjoyed a perfect milestone game as he scored in Chelsea's 3-1 win at home to Swansea City.Back in the starting line-up for just the sixth time in the Premier League this season, Fabregas opened the scoring before Pedro and Diego Costa sealed the points as Chelsea moved 11 points clear atop the table.Asked about Fabregas' performance at Stamford Bridge, Conte said: "Cesc played a really good game but it's important for me to have these solutions and also to analyse each game and understand when we need to have a player with more quality."This is the right way to continue. I'm pleased to have these type of players, to have that is fantastic as a coach."Mauricio Pochettino reiterated the need for patience, though he insists Tottenham are on track to become one of the best clubs in Europe.Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has cast doubt over the club's title hopes, questioning whether they are ready to win trophies.Expectations are high at White Hart Lane after Tottenham finished third last season but Spurs' quest for silverware in 2016-17 is fading.Tottenham are 13 points adrift of Premier League leaders and London rivals Chelsea, while they were dumped out of the Europa League by Gent.And Pochettino has reiterated the need for patience, though he insists Tottenham are on track to become one of the best clubs in Europe."I think that we have pushed the expectation higher but that is normal because last season we were there - second, third in the league and that is good," Pochettino said ahead of Saturday's clash against Stoke City."But my question is maybe we are not ready. It's like the stadium, if we want to move today we are not ready to play there."But the important thing is the club. Our chairman has built the foundation. New facilities on the training ground, new stadium to provide and to be a better team, better club, bigger club."We have patience to build and try to work hard and try to find the players that we can add to achieve that. Work hard and be clever; that is very important."Juan Mata wants to prolong his stay at Manchester United as seeks Premier League and Champions League glory.Mata arrived at Old Trafford from Chelsea in 2014 and the Spain international has made more than 100 appearances, winning the FA Cup and Community Shield.The 28-year-old, who faced an uncertain future in Manchester having been sold by manager Jose Mourinho during the pair's time at Stamford Bridge, is out of contract at the end of 2017-18 and he wants to extend his time at United."I have two years left on my contract and I would like to stay beyond that," Mata said in quotes published by the Mirror and The Sun."I am happy here and obviously since I came we have won the FA Cup, Community Shield and now we have another chance to win a trophy."I am thinking that the fans are amazing here even in the bad moments so I am thinking what happens if we win thePremier Leagueor Champions League in the future years it will be incredible to celebrate them so I have that in my head."Mata can add an EFL Cup trophy to his collection if United beat Southampton in Sunday's final at Wembley.The EFL Cup will be the first of a number of big trophies for Manchester United under Jose Mourinho, according to club great Eric Cantona.Manchester United great Eric Cantona expects the club to win a number of trophies during Jose Mourinho's time in charge.Former Chelsea manager Mourinho will lead United out in the EFL Cup final against Southampton on Sunday, having won the competition three times while at Stamford Bridge.And Cantona, who claimed six major honours at Old Trafford, is backing the Portuguese to deliver further success throughout his tenure - starting at Wembley this weekend."I think [United] will win more than one trophy this season and the first one will be [the EFL Cup]," he told the club's website."Mourinho is a winner - he has won a lot of things and he is a great manager. I think United will win many things."The first one is important, I think. In a club like United, of course, you have the pressure of winning things so, when you win one, you have less pressure. But people ask for more of course, and Mourinho doesn't have any kind of problem with the pressure."He has been around for many years, he has been a manager of many great clubs and has won things with all of them, and improved the team every time, so he will win. They will win [the final], don't worry!"Cantona also believes Mourinho has worked to produce a more exciting brand of football since arriving at United."I think [Mourinho] plays more attacking football than he used to play and he tries to understand the expectation all the time [at United]," Cantona added."He is a very intelligent man, very clever, and he has a great sense of humour. I always said that before he came to United. He takes all the pressure on him, he doesn't care about any kind of pressure."He's great psychologically. He takes all the pressure on him so it's less pressure on others and so the players can enjoy [their football]."Juventus are in complete control of the Serie A title race and coach Massimiliano Allegri is well aware of that after the win over Empoli.Massimiliano Allegri is grateful that Juventus have their Serie A title hopes "in our own hands" after Saturday's 2-0 win over Empoli put them 10 points clear of Roma.Juve cruised to victory in Turin despite a wasteful first half, with a Lukasz Skorupski own-goal and an Alex Sandro strike proving decisive for the reigning champions.It was their 30th successive home win in Serie A and stretched their lead at the summit to 10 points, putting the pressure on Roma ahead of their trip to Inter on Sunday."We still need to play Roma this season and it'll do us good to see how they play," Allegri told Mediaset Premium. "It would be nice if Roma don't win, but the important thing is that we won tonight. Our destiny is in our hands."Napoli can still be in it, but the fact remains we have to focus only on ourselves and realise our destiny is in our own hands."The lads did very well. Empoli are, among the teams lower down in the table, the side who passes it around the most and that can be frustrating."We really regret conceding that goal against Palermo, otherwise it would have been seven straight clean sheets."Despite failing to score in Bayern Munich's 8-0 demolition of Hamburg, Carlo Ancelotti picked out Thomas Muller for special praise.Carlo Ancelotti insists Thomas Muller was key to Bayern Munich's 8-0 thrashing of Hamburg, despite the Germany international's failure to get on the scoresheet.Robert Lewandowski struck a hat-trick, while Kingsley Coman added a brace and Arturo Vidal, David Alaba and Arjen Robben also netted as Bayern retained a five-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.Muller, meanwhile, has scored just one league goal this season, but Ancelotti was quick to praise the 27-year-old after a marvellous win."Thomas Muller was the best player on the pitch, even if he did not score a goal," the Bayern coach said."If you win 8-0, with good weather and with a good mood in the stadium, the club, the team and the fans can go home happy."Antoine Griezmann has been linked with Manchester United, but Phil Neville is backing Marcus Rashford to reach the same level.Phil Neville believes Manchester United's Marcus Rashford can become as good as Antoine Griezmann in the next two or three years.Atletico Madrid's Griezmann has been heavily linked with a move to United, partly due to his friendship with Old Trafford star Paul Pogba.However, Neville sees 19-year-old Rashford - the pick of the club's recent academy graduates - reaching the France international's level in the near future."Marcus Rashford is good enough," he told The Times. "Marcus will need challenging all the time because he's got so much ability."You have got to be inspired by Griezmann [potentially] coming in. Marcus can be as good as Griezmann in two or three years' time."And Neville has backed Anthony Martial to impress, too, predicting that he and Rashford will learn from veteran team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic."You have to be inspired by playing with Zlatan," he continued. "Anthony Martial is the same - he's got the biggest opportunity to become one of the best Man United number nines if he grabs that opportunity."At the moment he's only grabbed it with one hand - he needs to grab it with two. Martial and Marcus have to learn from [Ibrahimovic], who's phenomenal."Rashford has scored seven goals in 34 games in all competitions this season, while Martial's return is seven strikes in 25 appearances.Serie A pacesetters Juventus are now 10 points clear thanks to a 2-0 win over Empoli, meaning the pressure will be on Roma away to Inter.Juventus cruised to a 2-0 win over struggling Empoli in Serie A on Saturday to go 10 points clear at the summit and pile the pressure on Roma ahead of their trip to Inter.The result was not as comfortable as it should have been given Juve's complete domination, but they eventually made the most of their superiority in the second half and extended their lead at the top of the table, with closest challengers Roma facing a tough journey to San Siro on Sunday.Juve unsurprisingly controlled the game from start to finish and could not be accused of failing to create enough chances, but their finishing let them down in what was a wasteful first-half showing.Mario Mandzukic was particularly culpable, as he spurned a host of opportunities and let Empoli off the hook.But he was crucial to Juve when they did eventually find the breakthrough in the 52nd minute, with his header inspiring a Lukasz Skorupski own-goal.Alex Sandro wrapped things up with a clever finish 25 minutes from time and Juve comfortably saw out their seventh successive Serie A win.The hosts were in charge right from the start in Turin and crafted several opportunities early on, with both strikers guilty of missing the target in the first 10 minutes.Gonzalo Higuain spurned their first chance, prodding wide from close range after Mandzukic's knock-down, before the Croatian followed suit, missing the bottom-left corner when latching on to Juan Cuadrado's teasing cross.Mandzukic went close again in the 27th minute, meeting Dani Alves' cross from the right and heading past the post after outjumping Vincent Laurini at the back stick.The Juve striker was then presented with a glorious chance to make amends for his previous mishaps after half an hour.But Mandzukic overcomplicated things by attempting to dribble around Skorupski when picked out by an inch-perfect Higuain pass and the goalkeeper came out on top.Miralem Pjanic then also saw a decent 20-yard effort narrowly miss the right-hand post just before the break.The forward's header from Cuadrado's cross struck the underside of the bar, bounced up off the ground and hit the frame of the goal again, before then bouncing off Skorupski and over the line for an own-goal.The hosts then essentially put the game beyond Empoli just after the hour mark  Alex Sandro collecting Alves' pass in the left side of the area with his back to goal, before spinning and finding the far bottom corner with a perfectly placed effort.Juve continued their search for more goals right until the end, with Higuain forcing Skorupski into action from close range in the final 15 minutes, but Empoli never looked capable of making them rue their missed chances as the home side eased over the finish line.- All of the last four Juventus' goals at home in the league have come in the second half of games, after scoring eight of the previous nine at the venue before half-time.
- The Bianconeri have now gone 30 Serie A home wins in a row  they have never conceded more than a single goal in a match during that streak.
- Juve have picked up 66 points so far, only twice have they done better after 26 MDs since 1994/95: 67 pts in 2005/06 and 69 pts in 2013/14.
- Gonzalo Higuain has scored only one goal over the last three Serie A home games, after scoring four in the previous three at home.Yet another defeat has worsened Bournemouth's relegation worries, but Eddie Howe is adamant his team will improve their situation.Eddie Howe remains confident Bournemouth will soon return to winning ways after they were beaten 2-1 by West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday.Bournemouth got off to a fine start when Joshua King gave them an early lead at The Hawthorns, but Craig Dawson quickly levelled the scoring before Gareth McAuley netted the winner after a costly error from goalkeeper Artur Boruc.The Cherries are now on a seven-game winless streak in the Premier League, but Howe claimed he is not panicking just yet."One way for us to get out of this run of form is to work smarter, not to change everything that's good about us," Howe told reporters."I believe in the players, I am not afraid to face it head on, we are in a relegation battle until the point we are safe."When you are not winning games there are errors from the team - it is not one person, we need to take collective responsibility."If we come back from this, and I am sure we will, then we will be a much better team for it. Destiny is in our own hands and we have got to force it our way."While Bournemouth are struggling, West Brom have been in fine form and this weekend's victory saw them hit their goal of 40 points with 12 games to go, much to the delight of Tony Pulis."Look at Claudio Ranieri and Leicester, as soon as you become complacent, this game has an unbelievable way of kicking you up the backside."After Mauro Zarate was substituted due to injury with his side leading, Watford's Walter Mazzarri was disappointed to draw with West Ham.Walter Mazzarri believes Mauro Zarate's injury cost Watford in the second half of their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham.Zarate won the penalty from which Troy Deeney handed Watford the lead and he was influential before suffering an apparently serious injury shortly before half-time.West Ham came back into the game in the second half, equalising through Andre Ayew and pushing for a winner before Michail Antonio was sent off.And Mazzarri pointed to Zarate's withdrawal as a key point in the game, suggesting Watford missed the 29-year-old, while his enforced withdrawal also limited the manager's options."He was also making a lot of difference on the pitch. Hopefully it is not too bad. But, if we speak about the game, I didn't like how we went down in the second half."We also committed some silly mistakes that we can avoid. It's not acceptable to allow them a goal on the counter-attack when you are winning 1-0.Slaven Bilic believes it was two points dropped for his West Ham side, despite fighting back from a goal down."Considering we were in good form and how well we played today, especially in the second half, it's two points dropped," he said."On the other hand, considering we are playing away against a good team and we conceded an early goal, there's always a danger you will concede a second then you can lose the game."Yeah, we lost two points - that's my point of view - but it's a good point. It's hard to come back away."
