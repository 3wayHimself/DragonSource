Since making his debut in 1999, Casillas has won five La Liga titles, three Champions Leagues, two Copa Del Reys, a World Cup and two Euros and played in a plethora of memorable fixtures against some of finest players ever to play the game of football.One might think that because of the sheer volume of games he has played in, the 35-year old might have difficulty remembering individual results and details of games but that's not the case with Iker Casillas.A video of Casillas in his Real Madrid days has been doing rounds, where the goalkeeper showed off his incredible memory.Those in the clip, who look like members of the Madrid coaching staff, are giving him specific games and seasons to recall and his ability to remember details from the fixtures and those who were on the scoresheet is seriously impressive.Two legends met a few nights ago as Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas renewed their brilliant bromance. And following Juventus' victory, the pair embraced with the Spanish keeper revealing what he said.Billed as Buffon vs. Casillas, the game ended 2-nil to Juve who bagged crucial away goals with the return leg in three-weeks. Goals from two substitutes secured the away win. Leicester have already began talks with former Real Madrid, Chelsea and Russia manager Guus Hiddink about taking over at the King Power stadium.Hiddink, who has managed both at club and international level during his 29 years in management, would bring vast amounts of experience and class to the Leicester set-up.The 70-year-old's knowledge of Premier League football is also adequate after his spell at Stamford Bridge in 2009 and 2015. also report that Leicester have also made an approach to Portuguese coach Vitor Pereira, who is currently at 1860 MunichBack in 1998, Nicky Butt's typically wayward strike hit me right in the head. I proceeded to fall off my chair. I cherish this moment.The Chelsea midfielder was in from the start for Antonio Conte's men as they went up against Swansea at Stamford Bridge.Despite being in and out of the Blues starting XI this season, Fabregas has still managed to be productive - scoring three times and assisting seven more for his team-mates.It was Fabregas' 300th game in the Premier League - a number no other Spaniard has ever achieved. And he marked the occasion with a goal and an assist in a 3-1 win.Fabregas will now be hoping his form will be enough to persuade Conte that he's deserving of a regular spot in the starting XI as they target the Premier League title.Back in 1998, Nicky Butt's typically wayward strike hit me right in the head. I proceeded to fall off my chair. I cherish this moment.In total, excluding competitions such as the UEFA Super Cup, Community Shield or Club World Cup, Liverpool have won 41 major honours and are therefore the most successful club in English football.One Manchester United fan made Liverpool's official Twitter account well aware of that with this tweet:In fact, Liverpool were pretty much forced to change their biography because of that little bit of social media activity.The United fan was clearly absolutely loving his bit of banter forcing Liverpool to change their bio, judging by his tweets that followed:Friday 24th February 2017. The day Mourinhomindset made Liverpool insecure and change their bio because he told him to. Never forget it.As they often do, Liverpool fans will no doubt be cheering on United's opponents Southampton tomorrow and the Anfield club will obviously be looking to see if there are any more players they can sign from Saints.The Irish winger is now turning out for the English Championship side on loan after finding himself out of favour at Everton at the start of the season.McGeady, 30, last played for Everton in August 2015 and even found himself struggling to get a game during a loan spell with promotion-chasing Sheffield Wednesday last season.But the man who created such a buzz early on in his Celtic career at least looks to be improving with North End.He was instrumental as they earned a hard-fought 2-1 win over QPR today, netting the sort of goal that Celtic fans may remember from his time at Celtic Park:That bit of genius got Preston back on level terms after Kazenga Lua Lua gave the visitors the lead and his side got the winner through Jordan Hugill with 20 minutes to go.As good as McGeady's goal was though, it's a tad disappointing he didn't manage to squeeze his trademark 'McGeady Spin' in there as well.The Italian shot-stopper turned 18 today as he continues to impress in the Milan first team. Incredible.Milan set up a camera to film Donnarumma's reaction to a special tribute video, but they probably didn't expect Gianluigi to get so emotional.Donnarumma made his debut in the 3-1 friendly defeat at the hands of France when he replaced the legendary Gianluigi Buffon for the second half.Having entered the world of international football at just 17 years and 189 days, he became the youngest ever goalkeeper to don the iconic Azzurri goalkeepers shirt.The budding star rose to prominence last season and has since established himself as the main-man while becoming the face of the fallen European giants.Back in 1998, Nicky Butt's typically wayward strike hit me right in the head. I proceeded to fall off my chair. I cherish this moment.An idea I came up with, that could be useful, is for you and an opponent to put together an ultimate XI by picking a player from the very top leagues on the game and creating a team. You select an MLS team and transfer all the players there, mainly because they've got some beautiful kits and have a lot of slots available and then play the game on kick-off.Playing a friendly on Ultimate Team, he has somehow hacked the game and increased the size of his players so that they are as big as the Great Khali.Oddly, the ball has remained the same size, therefore meaning the visual image resembles a bunch of giants playing against each other with a golf ball.Sticking with FIFA 17, a chap on Reddit came up with a trick to combat the annoying instances where defenders on the line stop your goal-bound free-kicks.For German giants Bayern Munich, they have a whole lot of joy against Hamburg in the Bundesliga, who are regularly destroyed by Bayern.Today was no different, as Carlo Ancelotti's side utterly annihilated their opposition 8-0 at the Allianz Arena today.Robert Lewandowski grabbed his fifth hat-trick of the season, Kingsley Coman bagged a brace, while Arturo Vidal, David Alaba and Arjen Robben were all on the scoresheet in Carlo Ancelotti's 1000th game in management.And it was deja vu for Hamburg, who have been on the end of so many routs from Bayern in recent years - as the statistics showed:Bayern Munich: Have scored eight goals in a Bundesliga game for the first time since beating Hamburg 8-0 in February 2015 Hamburg's record away vs Bayern Munich is comfortably the worst among all clubs in the top five leagues in the last ten seasons.Ranieri was relieved of his duties at the King Power Stadium on Thursday to the shock of football fans around the world.The Foxes had been struggling domestically, but won the Premier League title just nine months ago and are still capable of achieving safety this season and have a chance of going through to the quarter finals of the Champions League.Vardy and several senior Leicester players were reportedly consulted by the club's owners before they decided to drop the axe on Ranieri.But that's something the English striker has denied in his tribute to Ranieri - a post that comes three days after the news was confirmed by the club:Vardy was one of the standout players as Leicester won the Premier League last season, but he's underperformed this term - scoring just seven goals in all competitions.It even applies to Manchester United, who have gone off the boil in recent years but have always been synonymous with winning silverware.Manchester United are already without Henrikh Mkhitaryan for the big game at Wembley after he picked up a hamstring injury in the second leg Europa League last 32 win over Saint-Etienne.And when there was no sight of Juan Mata in photos of the squad arriving in London today posted on United's twitter account, you could almost feel the butterflies in the stomach of many United fans.Of course, it could just be that Mata was elsewhere or not in shot but it seems like that pre-Cup final anxiety is kicking in for United fans.UPDATE: Fortunately for Manchester United fans, it appears that Mata has not been and injured and dropped and there is a good reason he is not currently with the squad.Spanish reports claim Juan Mata is on his way back to London after attending the funeral of his grandfather today
