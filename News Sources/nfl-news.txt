NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that the 33-year-old has no plans to retire and will be a hot commodity during free agency. Mangold implied as much when he thanked the organization on Twitter: "While this is a sad day to leave so many great coaches, teammates and executives, "Decisions of this magnitude are always difficult, but even more so with someone like Nick who has meant so much to this organization," general manager Mike Maccagnan explained. "We appreciate not just his on-field contributions, but the imprint that his mentality and approach to the game leaves on this team." in the same first round as left tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson in 2006, Mangold held down the fort in the middle of New York's offensive line for 11 seasons, replacing former All-Pro center Kevin Mawae. Mangold was selected to seven Pro Bowls and earned All-Pro honors in 2009 and 2010 when he acted as the backbone of New York's ground-and-pound offense during its championship game runs. Mangold was one of the ' most consistent players during his time there, starting and playing in 154 of a possible 160 regular-season games through 2015. ' dismal 2016 campaign, making him and his $9.075 million cap hit in 2017 expendable. The veteran center will hit the open market with just one year remaining on a seven-year contract in New York.For New York, Mangold's exit frees up more cap space for a needed reconstruction, but weakens what was one of the  as Mangold's replacement; Johnson started eight games in Mangold's absence last year and has been with the team since 2015. At left and right tackle, there are gaping vacancies that will need addressing in the shallow free agency pool and draft class. have lost long-tenured stalwarts at left tackle (Ferguson) and center (Mangold). No offseason splash, at quarterback or otherwise, will be able to make up for those exits in the short term. The rebuild in East Rutherford is underway.

It's fun to think of Rex racing to his dresser this morning -- huge toothy grin on his face -- and pulling that old favorite over his head as Rob impatiently honks the horn of his truck in the driveway.

The workout might not be full-speed but is a progress indicator after the first-round pick appeared in just two games last season. The development comes after coach Jay Gruden noted last month that February would be a vital time in Doctson's rehab. The No. 22 overall pick strained his right Achilles tendon during spring drills last season, and the injury lingered the rest of the summer. He opened the season on the roster, but played little. He corralled just two catches for 66 yards in the first two games of the season. He has been sidelined since Week 3.  set to garner wide-ranging interest on the open market, Doctson's health will be under the microscope this offseason. If both veterans leave, Doctson will need to play a big role alongside

He all but ended any serious debate about who is the greatest quarterback of all-time.Brady now has more titles than any quarterback, and if he continues to thrive in his age-40 season and beyond, it's quite possible he'll retire with every relevant statistical record. Even the biggest Peyton Manning, Johnny Unitas or Joe Montana fan in the room will admit that's tough to beat.in an interview that aired this week. "I have gotten to know him over the years, he is a fantastic guy. He had an incredible MVP season and sitting there 28-3 I think everybody watching and probably at the game was thinking, 'Atlanta is gonna get their ring sized up here pretty soon.' So that was disappointing."So from a fan's perspective, what a great game to watch and to see Tom in his greatness on display one more time. I mean, he didn't need to win that to prove that he's the G.O.A.T., but just another part of his legacy there."I'm probably (OK, almost certainly) reading into it way too much, but I like how Rodgers appears to swallow his pride before acknowledging that Brady is the greatest:By the way, there is an alternate reality where it is Rodgers, and not Brady getting love as the G.O.A.T. right about now. Stay with me here: Let's imagine that the  LI. Rodgers would end the season on a mythological 10-game winning streak with a final victory over Brady, who would head to the mountains in Montana stuck on four rings and having lost three of his last four Super Bowls.

"You've got to play through some things."Pointing to an earlier era of play, Coughlin singled out new receivers coach Keenan McCardell -- a player drafted in the 12th round in 1991 -- as someone who embodied that quality of on-field grit during his improbable 16-year career."To look at Keenan, to look at his background, where he came from and what he was able to accomplish, you better believe he can share information to the players in that room on how to be successful in this league. It starts with toughness," Coughlin said. "Now that's not the first thing on most people's lists when it comes to talking about receivers. But you talk about a guy who's tough, he wouldn't miss a practice with a separated shoulder. That's a little bit of something that has to happen. This league can benefit from more of that attitude and this team from that attitude as well."Coughlin emphasized he wasn't urging players to forge on through a "serious injury," but noted: "You're a pro. This isn't passing camp. It's a tough game, it's a tough business. You've got to play through some things if your team is gonna succeed."Coughlin went on to level Jacksonville's low-wattage offense as an operation in need of more balance. After the team "boasted" the league's largest run-pass imbalance last season, Coughlin was asked if that dynamic bothered him."A lot," Coughlin said. "I don't think you're helping the quarterback at all when you don't rush the football. I think for our team to be successful in this division -- noting that there are teams that'll come in and run the ball and try to hold the ball, keep your offense on the sideline -- we need to be able to do some of that as well."Coughlin wasn't finished: "It's easy to say it's a correctable thing, but as you know in this league, you get behind, you're trying to find ways to get back in the game as fast as you can no matter whether it's three points or 10 points."Too often for Jacksonville, it was 10 points, or more, last season. Coughlin wants to see a team that imposes its will on the field -- not one being pushed around by burlier outfits from the AFC South and beyond.

Harbaugh clashed with the front office, and the deteriorating relationship led to Harbaugh's move to the University of Michigan in 2015. Harbaugh has continued to win at his alma mater, and this week he reminisced on his San Francisco tenure "I don't think that I was there long enough to be compared with Bill Walsh or Coach Seifert," Harbaugh said. "... Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we did set a record for coaching there the longest under the present ownership. I take pride in that. Maybe there should be an endurance medal, a courage medal for that."Harbaugh tells no tall tales. Harbaugh's four-year run was positively Shula-esque when you look at the turnover by the bay since 2008. A brief rundown:

The most recent back injury stemmed from a Throughout his football career, the 27-year-old Gronk has endured eight surgeries. He played just eight games in 2016 and has only appeared in 16 games twice in his career. "I'm not really sure," he said when asked how long he plans on continuing his career. "I still love playing the game, and as of right now, I want to play as long as I can possibly play. My mindset is to keep on going."

I like the look in his eye. When the game starts and you're watching the game, you feel calm watching him play -- and that's a good trait because you trust him." While Payton's observation is the type of highly unscientific generality that has come to define offseason football chatter, he's not alone. The inability to completely remove Prescott from the ' dynamic rushing offense and evaluate him independently has made him an interesting topic to discuss. People have to rely on about 100-150 throws or "moments" that they have decided make Prescott a franchise quarterback in their minds. Others, jaded by the , Derek Andersons, Robert Griffin IIIs, Josh Freemans, Colin Kaepernicks and Kevin Kolbs of the world, prefer a larger sample size. While I am always a fan of a larger sample size, a Prescott "drop off" would also be dependent on a ton of other factors around him. It could be years before we get a complete picture of the quarterback he can and will be. Prescott won this year's Rookie of the Year award after throwing for 3,667 yards, 23 touchdowns and four interceptions. In a white-knuckle NFC divisional playoff game, he was 24 of 38 for 302 yards, three touchdowns and an interception.  fans to believe there is no need to worry about the future.
