I owed Claudio to find the right and appropriate words!"Claudio has and always will have my complete respect! What we achieved together and as a team was the impossible! He believed in me when many didn't and for that I owe him my eternal gratitude."There is speculation I was involved in his dismissal and this completely untrue, unfounded and is extremely hurtful!"The only thing we are guilty of as a team is underachieving which we all acknowledge both in the dressing room and publicly and will do our best to rectify. I wish Claudio the very very best in whatever the future holds for him. Thank You Claudio for everything."It has proved to be a miserable title defence and with results going against them at the weekend, the Foxes have plummeted into the relegation zone having lost their last five Premier League games. and he was back at the training ground for the last time on Saturday to say his final goodbyes to former players and staff.Defender Morgan tweeted: "Would just like to say a big thank you to Claudio for what was achieved at Leicester and becoming Premier League champions and competing in the Champions League."This is something I'd never thought was possible and it happened.

You believed in me from day one. Huge thank you for everything and good luck. God bless."Chelsea took advantage of their Premier League pursuers' idle Saturday to open an 11-point lead with a 3-1 defeat of Swansea at Stamford Bridge.Cesc Fabregas' strike on his 300th league appearance (19) set the leaders on their way, although it took late goals from Pedro and Diego Costa to get the job done after Fernando Llorente headed an equaliser in first-half stoppage time.Swansea may point - with some justification - to an unpunished Cesar Azpilicueta handball in his own penalty box with the score at 1-1, referee Neil Swarbrick apparently ruling the close-quarters contact accidental.But Chelsea were good value for a welcome win after twice dropping points in their past three matches, and they might have won by more as Fabregas alone came close to a hat-trick during a rare 90 minutes under Antonio Conte.A sixth start in this season's Premier League made him the first Spanish member of the competition's 300 club, and he took his landmark appearance as an opportunity to showcase his enduring class.Fabregas played the midfield metronome role to perfection - as much ticky-tocka as tiki-taka - splintered his short passing with the odd well-aimed slingshot into the runs of Costa and Eden Hazard, and caused Swansea countless problems with his ambitious late arrivals in their box.One such run brought the opener as a Pedro pass aimed at Costa was quickly brought under control and prodded into the far corner with Lukasz Fabianski still setting himself.Fabianski denied his old Arsenal team-mate a second shortly afterwards and later stood spectating as Fabregas' firm side-footer rebounded off his crossbar.By that stage the game was level. Somehow. Swansea manager Paul Clement, returning to the club where he won the title as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant, had called the trip a "shot to nothing" for Swansea, but they registered naught in the shots column until the final few seconds of the first half when Gylfi Sigurdsson's flat free-kick was met by Llorente as Chelsea's defence dithered.Had the game finished even there might have been words about the legitimacy of the free-kick - dubiously awarded against N'Golo Kante - but Swansea had a complaint of their own when Azpilicueta's outstretched arm blocked Sigurdsson's flick after the break.The moment passed and Chelsea exacted full toll. Fabianski, who had outdone his first-half stop from Fabregas with a better one to deny Hazard, was at fault as he dived over a Pedro curler (72) which was decent but no more.And the game was up when Costa slammed in Hazard's cut-back on the volley (84) for a 16th league goal, Swansea slipping to a third league defeat of Clement's promising tenure that leaves them three points above the relegation places with an overdue run of four bottom-half opponents to come. Courtois (6) Moses (6) Azpilicueta (7) Luiz (6) Cahill (7) Alonso (7) Kante (7) Fabregas (8) Pedro (8) Hazard (7) Costa (7) Fabianski (7) Naughton (5) Mawson (6) Fernandez (6) Olsson (5) Cork (6) Fer (5) Carroll (4) Sigurdsson (6) Routledge (5) Llorente (7)Scotland snapped a nine-game losing streak against Wales as two second-half tries clinched a 29-13 victory at Murrayfield.Wings Tommy Seymour and Tim Visser both crossed for the hosts as they overturned a 13-9 half-time deficit, with Finn Russell kicking 19 points.The majority of the first half was a stop-start affair, dogged by scrum resets before the first moment of real quality resulted in a try for Liam Williams.

Rhys Webb caught Scotland napping on 24 minutes with a quick tap after Wales were awarded a free-kick at the scrum, and with the home defence too narrow, some precise passing across the pitch saw Williams dive over in the corner.Scotland only found their groove with five first-half minutes remaining and a late Russell penalty saw them trail by four at the break, but they picked up where they left off after the restart. A great dummy line from Huw Jones fixed Williams and allowed Seymour to cross in the corner.After a Welsh purple patch yielded no points, Scotland punished them on 67 minutes when Russell and Stuart Hogg combined to put Visser over, and Russell's fifth penalty secured a second successive home win.Half-time came at the wrong time for Scotland as they had finally found their groove late in the half, but they managed to carry it into the second period and outscored their opponents 20-0.Some great backline play saw Seymour score and Scotland then withstood a sustained spell of Welsh pressure before Visser bagged their second try.Webb was outstanding during the opening period, constantly sniping around rucks, and his quick thinking created Wales' try. Justin Tipuric also excelled at the breakdown as the visitors bossed the contact area for the first 40.However, the second half was all about Scotland. Hogg showed flashes of his brilliance before half-time when his run and grubber almost resulted in a try for Jones, and the full-back had a hand in both tries.Russell also answered his critics with an accomplished kicking display and Scotland showed great patience in the lead-up to their second try, going through 14 phases before moving the ball wide.The scrums were a mess and the game struggled to flow as a result, while Wales failed to trouble the scoreboard during the final 46 minutes.The visitors declined a shot at goal on 50 minutes and kicked to touch, where they attempted an 11-man driving lineout but were pinged for crossing. "I'm really happy for a number of reasons. We set out to win the game but at half-time we weren't particularly well placed to do that."The players adjusted well after the break and I thought we scored a couple of nice tries and transferred pressure back onto Wales. We decided we could influence the outcome if we did a few things. I'm very proud of that response."We failed to take a couple of clear-cut chances, and they proved far more clinical near our line, although we conceded soft tries by letting them get outside us."We got turned over too easily and lost the aerial battle as well, so there is a lot for us to dissect."Jones, asked whether he might have gone for the points with hindsight, replied: "I would have liked to. The kickers didn't want to, so we went for the corner. Then I got done for blocking at the back of the lift, but I would have liked to have gone for the three."Welsh accuracy has utterly failed them in second half. I have seen more accurate broken clocks. Scotland magnificent.Gavin McDonnell's brave bid to win a world title ended in defeat as Rey Vargas claimed the WBC super-bantamweight belt with a majority decision win.The Doncaster man had hoped to join brother Jamie as a world champion, becoming the first British twins to hold titles, but his spirited finish could not deny Vargas from taking victory with two scores of 117-111, 116-112, while the third judge controversially made it a 114-114 draw.Vargas stalked McDonnell menacingly in the opener, slipping hooks from head to body, and there was a concerned expression on the Yorkshireman's reddened face by the end of the round.Stern words from trainer David Coldwell prompted McDonnell to stand his ground in the second and he landed a decent right hand on Vargas, who replied with more thudding body shots.

Maintaining a busy work-rate, McDonnell enjoyed success in the third, as he answered with crisp punches of his own.McDonnell was holding his own by the fifth and was denied a knockdown when referee Victor Loughlin ruled a push after Vargas dropped to his knees on the canvas.But Vargas expertly controlled the sixth off the back foot, spearing McDonnell with a straight right hand, and the British fighter's nose was bloodied by the end of the seventh.With Vargas pulling into a comfortable lead, McDonnell desperately tried to turn the fight dramatically in his favour, and briefly bothered Vargas with a right hand in the eighth.But the superior firepower lay with Vargas and the effect of his stinging punches was evident on McDonnell's swollen features.McDonnell marched forward in the closing rounds as the home crowd chorused his name, but Vargas had already done enough to claim the WBC belt on two of the scorecards.Manchester United and Southampton clash in the EFL Cup final on Sunday at Wembley - but who will come out on top?

Romelu Lukaku equalled Everton's Premier League scoring record as he netted in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Goodison Park on Saturday.The striker moved level with Duncan Ferguson on 60 league goals for the Toffees when he scored in the 80th minute.Earlier, Idrissa Gueye scored his first Premier League goal to give the hosts the lead, firing home towards the end of a first half that Everton dominated.Sunderland threatened a response after the break and went close to equalising when Jermain Defoe saw a shot strike the bar and bounce down on the line.But moments later Lukaku wrapped up the win for Everton, who are now unbeaten in nine league matches.Sunderland, meanwhile, remain rooted to the foot of the table and are three points from safety after Crystal Palace's win against Middlesbrough.Having conceded six on their last visit to Goodison Park, it was little surprise that the Black Cats opted for a defensive game plan from the start.It almost unravelled early as Jordan Pickford - back in goal for the first time since Boxing Day after recovering from injury - fumbled a shot from Ademola Lookman and had to recover quickly to stop it rolling in.Otherwise Sunderland largely kept Everton at bay, with Gueye going closest for the hosts with a shot from a tight angle that Pickford saved.

Former Everton defender Bryan Oviedo saw an effort deflect wide at the other end after a rare Sunderland attack.But the hosts did take the lead after 40 minutes when Tom Davies picked out Coleman with a fine cross-field pass and he rolled it on to the penalty spot for the on-rushing Gueye to fire in first time.The lead was nearly doubled before the break as Ross Barkley saw a shot from 25 yards saved and Davies struck the post with an effort from the edge of the box.Everton lost their grip on the game after half-time and Defoe had an effort blocked as Sunderland started to offer more in the attacking third.But they couldn't create clear chances and Everton went close with Barkley shooting wide and then Pickford saving from Lukaku.The pivotal moment came in the 79th minute when Defoe, who had hardly been involved in the match, struck the bar, with Lukaku doubling Everton's lead seconds later after breaking away from Oviedo.
