                        The device, which is produced by Chinese-manufacturer TCL and was formerly known as the Mercury, is distinctly BlackBerry.For starters, it incorporates the beloved physical hardware keyboard. While some may find it a bit anachronistic, it remains one of the most comfortable ways to type out a long email or document on a mobile phone.And as weve seen with previous BlackBerry devices, the keyboard itself can be used as a navigation device, allowing users to traverse through the phone by swiping. This functionality debuted on the BlackBerry Passport, way back in 2014.On the KEYone, the physical keyboard has been turbo-charged, allowing you to use each key as a shortcut, assigning keys to apps and actions. By short- or long-pressing the letter u, for example, you can launch UberAs is expected these days, the full details for the device were leaked slightly before the event, and while respectable, are unlikely to set anyones world on fire. As expected, theres a 4.5-inch touchscreen with a 1620 x 1080-pixel resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio.Moving on to the camera, its rear-shooter is a 12MP Sony IMX378, which supports 4K video at 30FPS, and has an f/2.0 lens. Its selfie camera is a perfectly decent 8MP affair.At the bottom of the device, theres a USB-C port for charging. The gorgeous and slender aluminum design also incorporates a headphone jack, the usual volume rocker and power key, plus a function key that can be configured as required.The KEYone also boasts a textured back cover, which TCL promises will improve your grip on the device.As has been the case with previous devices, the KEYone runs a relatively untouched version of Android Nougat 7.1, complimented by BlackBerrys security and productivity software, like the BlackBerry Hub and DTEK.Powering it is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 Octa-core chip, backed up with 3GB of RAM, and a gigantic 3,505mAh battery. This supports Quick Charge 3.0, and is accompanied with something called Boost, which further speeds up the charging process by putting it into battery saving mode. It comes with 32GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card.The KEYone is a distinct and gorgeous device. As BlackBerry focuses more on its major profit centers  namely software and services  its nice to know that the current licensor to the BlackBerry name hasnt forgotten its roots, and can produce a device that makes us drool.The device will be available from April, 2017, and will be priced at 599 in Europe, 499 in the UK, and $549 in the US. Details about pre-order availability can be found

                        The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is trying to block a privacy rule which would protect your internet data. ruled last year that internet service providers (ISPs) would be required to adopt reasonable security measures to protect their customers data by March 2. Now Pai is seeking a stay on that rule.One of the security measures companies will no longer have to abide by is getting consumer consent before sharing sensitive information. According to , the information includes browsing history, childrens information, location, and Social Security numbers., a spokesman says Chairman Pai requested the stay because he wants the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission to treat all online entities the same way:All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, and the federal government shouldnt favor one set of companies over another.Therefore, he has advocated returning to a technology-neutral privacy framework for the online world and harmonizing the FCCs privacy rules for broadband providers with the FTCs standards for others in the digital economy.Ajit Pai has been open about his opposition to net neutrality since his appointment by Donald Trump in . Whether this is part of a larger push to roll back legislation protecting said neutrality remains to be seen.

                        Over 5.5 million websites use CloudFlare, and chances are youre using one of them daily. Sites like FitBit, Yelp, Medium are just a small sample of sites that rely on the service. Todays announcement that it had been leaking sensitive information for several months means its possible, probable even, that youll have a password or two that made its way into the wild.Its outside the grasp of most web users, but for someone used to crafting specific search engine queries to lookfor leaked data, the information is there. Travis Ormandy, the Google employee who discovered the vulnerability, found it precisely this way. [After discovering the data], we figured out how to reproduce the problem. It looked like that if an html page hosted behind CloudFlarehad a specific combination of unbalanced tags, the proxy would intersperse pages of uninitialized memory into the output (kinda like heartbleed, but CloudFlarespecific and worse for reasons Ill explain later).We fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major CloudFlare-hosted sites from other users. Once we understood what we were seeing and the implications, we immediately stopped and contacted CloudFlaresecurity.The number of leaks was relatively small  about .00003% of HTTP requests (according to CloudFlare). The implications, however, are huge. Its now patched, buthackers may still be able to target the compromised sites to further extract sensitive data, or as security researcher  wrote: presence of data in searchable caches might make small-scale exploitation possible. Lackey also mentioned its likely not an end of the world event, as vulnerable data is probably fairly randomly distributed across the internet.Still, the potential for abuse isnt nothing. Because of this, its never a bad idea to change your passwords, at least at affected sites.is a good place to start. Theweb app lets you submit sites you use regularly to determine whether or not they were affected by the CloudFlare vulnerability.If its sound advice youre looking for, its a great time to change any re-used password. The vulnerability is patched, but passwords are now in the wild. Any password you used to access more than one site could open the door for hackers to gain entry using your credentials. Put simply, your leaked OKCupid password could give hackers access to your Google account, or your bank  if they use the same password.

                        The internets favorite love-to-hate/hate-to-love site is attempting to expose people to the opinions of others. Heres why thats a bad thing.itsrolling out an experimental new feature called Outside Your Bubble.A module sits at the bottom of itsnews articles, showing off comments from readers. The comments are curated from social media, and will  so BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith says  bring reader attention to the varied reactions and viewpoints related to that story.BuzzFeedNews deals in some pretty controversial topics, including politics, cultural divides, criminal justice, and all the overlap between, so its fair to assume the comments in question will be loaded and potentially incendiary.Im not saying the free exchange of different ideas is a bad thingfar from it. Im saying the whole Bubble BuzzFeed wants to burst is bullshit.Reviewing articles where BuzzFeed has already rolled out the feature, I do have a positive note: All of the comments are well-curated, and it looks like real effort was put into separating the wheat from the chaff. The comments chosen for That said, the assumption underpinning this is that people of different political/racial/financial spheres might not be aware how the other side feels. The pretentious name Outside Your Bubble is a dead giveaway. of the opinions of others. Between the news and social media, the only way to not hear from other people on the internet is to not be on the internet.In my experience, people understand that other opinions exist, and what the opinions are. What people dont understand is where the opinions come from, and they dont care to find out for themselves. Thats where BuzzFeeds module falls short at best, and contributes to the problem at worst.BuzzFeeds comments, though curated, dont provide context or authenticity. The reader doesnt know who the person is, and why they hold their beliefs, or even what theyd have to do to change that persons mind.I think whats going to happen is that people will do what they always do on social media, and start yelling at each other. And this time, theres a big, shiny box telling them exactly who to yell at.Internet anonymity goes both ways. Usually we use it to describe trolls who hide behind digital blackout curtains while taunting others. But the opposite is also true: People are more likely to self-righteously dogpile on a random name online than a person they can put a face to and empathize with.First, dont takea shortcut around proper reporting.Regurgitating what a person says without context doesnt foster understanding ofwants to promote the exchange of different view points, then interviewing people and providing context about their lives and beliefs would be more conducive.Second, authenticate your sources. How does onedetermine whether the person espousing the opinion actually feels that way or is being incendiary?Find sources that have a history of thought-out comments and demonstrate an appreciable consistency of opinion.BuzzFeed already has a patchy history when it comes to sourcing content. Itsbeen accused of plagiarizing . Id hate to see them citing random social media noise as viable viewpoints on important social issues.Still, theres a chance BuzzFeed and irserstwhile readers could prove me wrong. Well see how their experiment goes.

                        I adopted my dog, Ripple, at the ripe old age of 12. Ripple is a sweet old man, with plenty of character and personality, but hes also got some problems.He suffers from severe cataracts that limit his vision, especially at night. He also has acute separation anxiety  something which is particularly common among Yorkshire Terriers. Short of having him follow me everywhere I go (which, obviously, isnt tenable), theres not a lot you can do about that.But I recently discovered thats not entirely true after stumbling upon Furbo  a device that empowers you to soothe and entertain your dog, no matter where you might be., makes it possible to view your dogs movements through its built-in HD video camera, as well as communicate with it, thanks to a microphone and deafeningly-loud speakers. It even lets you feed your pet pooch treats without having to touch them.The Furbo isnt a flashy-looking device. You could even describe it as plain. Its body is a solid slab of white PVC, save for the parts that house the devices webcam. Its lid  which you lift to load the device with dog treats  is a walnut-colored wood.But this isnt a bad thing because its not supposed to stand out. Its supposed to blend in. Its no more obvious than an Ikea lamp, or a vase.Ive had the pleasure of playing with the Furbo for over a month now. At first, I was skeptical. While its true that dogs take comfort from the company of their owners, they dont just merely associate it with a voice. For canines, its more visceral, and includes senses like smell and taste. Although the Furbo is a rather ingenious device, its unable to replicate that.  my dogs immense anxiety from being alone. I was worried that by hearing my voice, but not seeing or smelling me, he might be frightened., per canine psychology expert Stanley Coren, but I think the Internet of Things might be a little advanced for old Ripple.But my concerns were groundless. Although Im not quite convinced my dog understands what the Furbo is, its clear he loves it. Despite his cataracts, he gets so happy when I use it to fling Pedigree Cheesy Bites at him.And as an owner, the Furbo grants me an immense peace of mind. When my dog starts barking, both myself and my fiance are alerted through the mobile app, which is installed on both of our phones. And when he jumps on the couch (something which he is expressly forbidden to do; Yorkshire Terriers  to dig in the soil), I can see him do it and admonish him from a distance. I felt like a sniper, except instead of bullets I was firing a fierce The best part of the Furbo is  hands down  the ability to load the device with treats. To dispense some, you open the app and swipe up, like youre casting a Pokball in Pokmon Go.  sorry, bilingualism is important) treats. These were perfectly square, and the device dispensed one at a time.But I also tried it with some Pedigree Cheesy Bites, which are Ripples favorite treat. These are smaller, and are rather oblong. As a result, the Furbo dispensed several at a time, throwing them across the room like buckshot out of a shotgun. In the below picture, you can see a dog treat mid-flight.This isnt necessarily a bad thing, mind you. Ripple was thrilled to have several treats at a time, and he enjoyed hunting down the ones thatd fallen between crevices, and underneath the sofa.Setting up Furbo is trivially easy. Just turn it on and follow the instructions that come in the box. Setup was pretty painless, and took just five minutes. To control it, youre going to need a smartphone running a relatively recent version of Once youre connected, youll be able to view a constant stream of everything happening in the room. Pretty much everything youll want to do with Furbo  from speak to your dog, to throw treats  happens through this app.By default, the Furbo streams to your smartphone in 720p quality when connected to Wi-Fi. When you switch to cellular data, it goes a bit  circa 2006, but its still very much watchable. Even at the lowest visual quality, I was still able to make out both of Ripples teeth.As mentioned before, you throw treats to your dog via this view by swiping upwards. Annoyingly, it doesnt tell you when youve run out of treats, or how many youve got left. Thats my only  and biggest  complaint about the product.And of course, if you just want to admire your dog from a distance, you can mute your microphone and do just that.The makers of the Furbo arent selling a revolutionary new way to look after your dog. Theyre selling confidence. The confidence to ensure that your dog isnt anxious, or unhappy. The confidence that your prize pooch hasnt just pizzled over your rug.When you think about it in those terms, the $211 asking price for the Furbo doesnt seem too outlandish, does it?

                        After winning a $500 million lawsuit against Facebook, ZeniMax is now trying to block the company from selling itsOculus VR code. that ZeniMax filed an injunction against Facebook in a federal court in Dallas. The same court ruled in Zenimaxs favor , ordering Facebook and Oculus to pay a half-billion dollars to the game publisher for copyright infringement and violation of a non-disclosure agreement.In the injunction, ZeniMax demands that products using the disputed code be blocked from sale. Since the code is at the core of the Rift system, this could cost Oculus even more time and money to change it.ZeniMax first filed suit against Oculus in 2014, claiming former ZeniMax employee John Carmack and Oculus founderPalmer Luckey created the Rift from copyrighted code. The court ruled that ZeniMaxs trade secrets werent stolen, but that OculusOculus code is available to potential VR developers, as well as the Samsung Gear headset. If granted, the injunction would prevent Oculus from being able to sell some games for the Rift or Gear, limiting its potential profits.

                        So far, we know the problem generally presents itself as a forced log out from the service. After forcing users off the page, Facebook wont allow them to log back in, giving it the appearance that their account may be in use by another person. This doesnt seem to be the case, as dozens of users are all experiencing the same problem.Were short on details at the moment, but were working diligently to get to the bottom of it. We do know that the areas affected most heavily are in Europe, The United States (mainly the East and West Coast and parts of Texas), Brazil, and parts of Australia, according to  Facebook reached out to offer the following comment: Earlier today an error in one of our systems designed to help prevent suspicious account access sent a small set of people to our account recovery flow unnecessarily. We have fixed the issue and are in the process of clearing the affected accounts from this recovery flow. We apologize for any inconvenience.For affected users, since this was a technical error, not an actual security breach, it appears youll just have to wait. It doesnt appear your account is, or ever was, at risk. Facebook assures us theyre working to clear the queue of users whove attempted to reset their password after the outage. Some users are getting this message stating that someone logged in to their account. Dont panic, this is widespread and that doesnt appear to be the case.
