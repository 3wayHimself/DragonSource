US President Donald Trump has announced he will not attend the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on 29 April.The glitzy event draws celebrities, journalists and politicians, normally including the US president.Mr Trump said he would not attend a day after the White House excluded several major broadcasters and newspapers from a press briefing.The announcement, made via Twitter, comes as relations between the White House and some media outlets continue to deteriorate. On Friday, media groups including the BBC, CNN, the New York Times, the Guardian, the Los Angeles Times, Buzzfeed, the Daily Mail and Politico were among those Hours before the briefing, Mr Trump had delivered a strong attack on what he called "fake news" in the media, targeting stories with unnamed sources.He wrote: "I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!"Bloomberg News and the New Yorker magazine are among media outlets who have said they will not hold their usual after-parties this year.Every sitting president since 1924 has attended the correspondents' dinner at least once, according to the New York Times.They traditionally make a light-hearted speech at the annual event. Former US President Barack Obama attended eight times.In 2011, Barack Obama joked that Mr Trump would turn the White House into a casino if he became president and made fun of rumours, then propagated by Mr Trump, that President Obama was not born in the US.The New York businessman was shown on camera sitting stony-faced through a barrage of jokes at his expense, including some from host Seth Meyers, although he said last year that he "loved that dinner".In a statement the White House Correspondents' Association said it took note of the president's announcement and said the dinner would "continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic".The American coach of Olympic champion Mo Farah may have broken anti-doping rules to boost the performance of some of his athletes, says a leaked report.Alberto Salazar has been under investigation since a BBC Panorama programme made allegations about drugs use at his US training base.The leaked report also alleges Salazar, head coach of the world famous endurance Nike Oregon Project (NOP), routinely gave Farah and other athletes legal prescription drugs with potentially harmful side-effects without a justifiable medical reason. The investigation into Salazar, who is also a consultant to UK Athletics (UKA), has been under way since at least June 2015.The Usada interim report was passed to the Sunday Times by the suspected Russian hacking group Fancy Bears. The BBC has so far been unable to verify its authenticity with Usada, or establish whether any of its reported conclusions are out of date.In a statement, Usada said it could "confirm that it has prepared a report in response to a subpoena from a state medical licensing body regarding care given by a physician to athletes associated with the Nike Oregon Project".It said: "We understand that the licensing body is still deciding its case and as we continue to investigate whether anti-doping rules were broken, no further comment will be made at this time."Importantly, all athletes, coaches and others under the jurisdiction of the World Anti-Doping Code are innocent and presumed to have complied with the rules unless and until the established anti-doping process declares otherwise. It is unfair and reckless to state, infer or imply differently."Salazar maintains that drug use has always fully complied with the Wada code and that athletes were administered with L-carnitine in "exactly the way Usada directed".The report, apparently written in March 2016, allegedly states: "Usada continues to investigate circumstances related to L-carnitine use" by Farah.Farah, who has won 5,000m and 10,000m gold at the past two Olympic Games, told The Sunday Times two years ago that he had "tried a legal energy drink" containing L-carnitine but "saw no benefit" and did not continue with it.The revelations will pile more pressure on Britain's greatest ever endurance runner, who has steadfastly refused to end his association with Salazar.  to continue working with Salazar after an inquiry was launched following the BBC Panorama programme.  In June 2015, in conjunction with the US website ProPublica, the BBC's Panorama programme Catch Me If You Can made a series of allegations about the methods at NOP, and included testimony from a number of former athletes and coaches, including Kara Goucher and Steve Magness. The film alleged Salazar had a fixation on the testosterone levels of his athletes, and may have doped American Olympic medallist Galen Rupp with the banned steroid version when he was 16. The programme also alleged Salazar had conducted testosterone experiments on his sons to see how much of the drug he could apply to them before it triggered positive tests.  The film also alleged Salazar used thyroid medicine inappropriately with his athletes, and encouraged the use of prescription medication when there was no justifiable need.Usada took the unusual step of confirming it had launched an investigation into NOP following the BBC and ProPublica's revelations in 2015. Earlier stories by the New York Times and the Sunday Times had also raised concerns about some of Salazar's methods. A man has died and two other people were hurt after a man drove into a pedestrian area in Heidelberg, Germany.The attacker, said to have been armed with a knife, was shot, injured and arrested by police in a brief standoff after fleeing the scene on foot. In December an Islamist attacker drove a lorry into a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring 49. In Heidelberg the attacker, described by police as a 35-year-old German "without a migration background", drove what is thought to be a rental car into pedestrians in one of the city's central squares, injuring three people. One of them, a 73-year-old German man, later died in hospital.The attacker then left the car but was tracked down, shot and seriously injured by police near an old swimming pool. Police were unable to confirm local media reports that the attacker was mentally disturbed. He is thought to have acted alone.The two injured people were a 32-year-old Austrian national and a 29-year-old Bosnian woman, police said. Their injuries are said to be minor and they have been discharged from hospital.A woman has been charged with owning a dangerously out of control dog following the death of a three-year-old in Essex last year.Jade Dunne, 29, of Parker Way, Halstead, has been charged in connection with the death of Dexter Neal on 18 August. Dexter died after he was bitten at Ms Dunne's home. An American Bulldog, called Ruby, was later destroyed.He was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge before his death was confirmed later that day.At the time, neighbour Phyllis Young told the BBC the family had not lived in the street for long and "kept themselves to themselves".Following news of Dexter's death, she said: "It's so sad. I feel so sadly for the family who are involved. A semi-submersible ship carrying an oil platform is travelling from China's Zhejiang Province to the North Sea Oil Field in the UK. BBC journalist Caroline Wyatt has spoken of how the "brain fog began to lift" after she had pioneering treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).The former BBC defence correspondent was deemed unsuitable for an NHS trial and paid $60,000 (48,000) for a stem cell transplant in Mexico in January.Wyatt, 49, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that she was "feeling better than I have done in a long time".About 100,000 people in the UK are affected by MS, which can cause numbness, tingling in the fingers and sufferers may struggle to walk or think clearly.Wyatt decided to go to a private hospital in Puebla, Mexico, after talking to former patients, who had undergone a course of chemotherapy and transplanting stem cells."The chemo was to burn out the old faulty immune system so that you can have your stem cells harvested - and then brought back into the system," she said."People who had been in wheelchairs, or people who had been struggling to walk or to think or to speak clearly had come back after the treatment and, if you were a lay person, you'd say they looked cured, if you were a medic, you'd probably say they were in remission.""For me the results have been more gradual and gentle," the former BBC religious affairs correspondent and PM presenter said."Three weeks since coming back I am feeling better than I have done for a long time," she added. "The main thing that happened was that the brain fog began to lift."In MS the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis.The damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable. If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration.Wyatt, who first noticed some of the symptoms in 1990, said: "It is a very difficult disease to get diagnosed. "Because I was a journalist when I went to doctors they said, 'Ah, you've got repetitive strain injury'."She changed jobs but, following a relapse in 2001, she was given a brain scan and told she might have MS - a diagnosis that was confirmed following more invasive tests such as a spinal tap in 2015.Wyatt initially tried various drug treatments but as her condition began to deteriorate she began to investigate the stem cell treatment."I got in touch with Sheffield who were the British arm of a trial... and they  very kindly agreed to see me," she said."They did various tests but decided in the end that medically speaking I was not one of the best candidates so they couldn't do it here."Wyatt said that although UK bodies such as the NHS and watchdog NICE describe the treatment as experimental, about 80% of people who had the treatment responded to some degree and more than 50% saw the progression of their MS halted.The charity the MS Society says the treatment could have long-term benefits for some people with MS but that larger studies are needed to better understand the impact of this aggressive treatment compared with existing therapies.Actor David Harewood has said the next Doctor Who should not be another white man - and has thrown his own hat into the ring.The Homeland and Supergirl star is among the actors whose names have been suggested to replace Peter Capaldi."It needs to do something different, so I think it's either going to be a black person or a woman. It would just bring a different flavour to it."The 51-year-old British actor has already been in Doctor Who, appearing in the 2009-10 double bill The End of Time. He can currently be seen playing the Martian Manhunter in the The CW's Supergirl."I'm already playing an alien so maybe I could switch and play a Time Lord - who knows what's going to happen," he said. "It's nice to be in the running. It's an iconic role."The current bookmakers' favourite to take over the Tardis is Oscar-winning actress Tilda Swinton, and Harewood said she would be a good choice."She's extraordinary anyway so I think she'd be great," Harewood said. "It would be a very different Doctor and maybe that's what it needs."The actor said it was good that four of the five current favourites are women - with Maxine Peake, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Olivia Colman also tipped.Harewood was speaking at the Independent Spirit Awards in California, where he was nominated for best male lead for playing a Pentecostal minister trying to perform miracles in Free In Deed.Shifa Gardi, who worked for Iraqi Kurdish channel Rudaw, was killed by a roadside bomb as she covered the advance of Iraqi forces into western areas held by so-called Islamic State.The Iraqi troops entered western districts of Mosul for the first time on Friday as part of an offensive begun in October to drive the jihadists from their main stronghold.Gardi had been presenting a daily programme on the Mosul offensive for Rudaw TV and had recently started to cover the war from inside Mosul, the channel said on its website.After paying tribute to her, Rudaw recalled the recent incident where Gardi had found a wounded rabbit."The rabbit is suffering from malnutrition which has caused visible damage to its face. I brought it back with me. We will be treating the rabbit and then give it to an animal protection agency which is willing to look after it," she said.Special forces Lt Gen Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi told Associated Press his soldiers were "moving very slowly" in the face of attacks with car bombs, snipers and armed drones.He said the plan was to cut supply lines and link up with eastern districts that Iraqi forces declared "fully liberated" last month.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said now is "not the time" for a leadership contest, but the party must "do better" at winning over voters.Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference in Perth, he said the party's by-election loss in Copeland had been "hugely disappointing".Jeremy Corbyn has said he will stay on as leader, after Labour held Stoke Central in a separate by-election.In the other by-election this week, Labour retained its seat in Stoke-on-Trent Central, with newly elected MP Gareth Snell winning 37% of the vote - slightly down on the 39.3% Labour got in 2015. Mr Watson told delegates: "All of us with leadership roles in the Labour Party need to have a long hard look at ourselves at what's not working."I have said it a lot recently - this is not the time for a leadership election, that issue was settled last year."Mr Miliband, who now works as the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said: "I don't think this is just a repeat of the 1980s. But when asked if he would come back to politics, he said: "I honestly don't know what I am going to do. It's hard to see - but what's the point of saying never?"BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said some in Labour saw Mr Miliband as the best leader they never had, but it was not the first time he had been "a public doom-monger" about his party under Mr Corbyn.Labour had held the seat in Copeland for 80 years. PM Theresa May said the "astounding" victory there showed her government was "working for everyone".Trudy Harrison got 44.3% of the vote, increasing the Conservatives' vote share by more than 8%. She overturned a Labour majority of more than 2,564 to take the seat by 2,147 votes - a swing of more than 6%."The blame for these results does not lie solely with Jeremy Corbyn, but he must take responsibility for what happens next," he said. Gerard Coyne, who is standing to become general secretary of the Unite union, said there was "no doubt" Copeland was a "meltdown" for Labour.But he stopped short of calling on Mr Corbyn to step down, saying it was a matter for the party and its MPs.Mr Corbyn said Labour's "message was not enough to win through in Copeland" but he hailed victory in Stoke as a "decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty". Behind Labour's 37.1% share of the vote in Stoke, UKIP took 24.7% to come second, narrowly beating the Conservatives on 24.4%. Both UKIP and the Tories did slightly better than in 2015.Mr Perez, who served in the Obama administration, won the second round of voting at the Democratic National Committee meeting in Atlanta after a tightly-fought contest.He told his party they faced a crisis of confidence after the election of Donald Trump, whom he said was the worst president in US history.Mr Perez will face the tough task of trying to unite a party beset with lingering frictions between young progressive liberals who were sceptical of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party establishment, correspondents say."I am confident that when we lead with our values and lead with our actions we succeed. That is what the Democratic Party has always been about and that is what we will continue to be about", Mr Perez told party delegates.He said that while the 20 January inauguration of Mr Trump "was an undeniably important day", the mass protests that followed were "far more important for America".Nevertheless he acknowledged that the Democratic party was "suffering from a crisis of confidence, a crisis of relevance".It was billed as a proxy battle between progressives and moderates in the Democratic Party. The political revolutionaries who supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries largely lined up behind Congressman Keith Ellison. There were even some fireworks reminiscent of that recently concluded nomination fight, with prominent voices on both sides threatening to leave the party if the opposition won.Despite the drama, the Democratic committee chair is more behind-the-scenes organiser than ideological figurehead. With the party still stinging from its presidential defeat and extended drubbing at the state level in much of the US, Mr Perez faces a long, arduous job largely out of the spotlight.He must kick-start the party's fund-raising and recruit competent candidates for the 2018 midterm elections. He also has to lay the groundwork for the 2020 presidential nomination contest, which seems certain to be as contentious as it is wide-open.If he succeeds, the winning candidates will receive the credit. If he fails, the axe will fall quickly on his neck. The stakes are high for Democrats, and the pressure on Perez to perform starts now.
