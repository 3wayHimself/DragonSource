 have paid a heavy European price for their Wembley tenancy, but it feels more like an issue of personality, not postcode. The Potters will fancy taking a lump out of Spurs, but they are W0 D5 L7 against top 10 sides, conceding three goals on average in seven meetings with the top six. and his insatiable appetite for personal glory probably gets a bit tiresome for team-mates, but its a joy to behold if youve punted the greedy blighter anytime... Lily Allen has revealed that she is bipolar and also suffered post traumatic stress disorder after the loss of her baby son.When told by another user he felt she had mental health illness, she replied: I DO have mental health issues. Bi-polar, postnatal depression, and PTSD, does that make my opinion void?She later explained to her 5.9million followers that her PTSD occurred after her son was stillborn in 2010, six months into her pregnancy.She described the ordeal for the first time yesterday, in graphic detail, saying: I lay in a hospital bed with my deceased son stuck between my legs halfway out of my body for ten hours.Lily, 31, is well known for her wild behaviour  often appearing to be drunk in public and making outrageous political comments.The singer has also spoken about her postnatal depression following the births of her two young daughters, Ethel, five, and Marnie, four.At least 50 people have been injured - a dozen of them critically - after a car ploughed into a crowd watching a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans.An eyewitness told WSDU News that the grey pick-up "ricocheted" off a white and black car at around 30mph before ploughing into the crowd.A police spokeswoman told the New Orleans Advocate: "Initial reports show so far about a dozen people are in critical condition.Ukip donor Arron Banks has threatened to pull his funding unless he is made chairman so he can "purge" members and stop it being "run like a jumble sale".Following party leader Paul Nuttall's defeat to Labour in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election, Mr Banks blamed "dullards" like Ukip's only MP Douglas Carswell for not bringing in enough Tory votes.He said the defeat was the "final straw" in terms of Mr Carswell, accusing him of being preoccupied with "sabotaging" a knighthood for former leader Nigel Farage, an allegation strongly denied by the MP.Mr Banks said Mr Farage, who criticised Mr Nuttall for not being radical enough on immigration, would have a "more fulsome role" in the party under his stewardship.Mr Banks told The Sunday Express: "I am giving Paul Nuttall an ultimatum that either I become chairman and sort out Ukip by bringing in business people and professionals to make the party electable, or I am out of there."If Nuttall doesn't professionalise it and toss out the likes of Douglas Carswell, Suzanne Evans and the rest of the Tory cabal then the party is finished anyway."These dullards aren't bringing in Tory votes, Stoke proved that, so what are they for? The party now needs to bring in serious people to fix its ramshackle administration, stay relevant, and stay radical or it will die."From what I hear far from winning elections, Carswell's main concern is sabotaging Nigel's knighthood, which is why he must leave the party."Mr Banks, who recently launched the brash right-wing website Westmonster, said he is going to make a formal complaint about Mr Carswell to Ukip's national executive committee for bringing the party into "disrepute"."Mr Carswell is a career politician and doesn't care about Ukip and he has got to get out," the businessman said."Carswell is welcome to go back to the Tories or stand as an independent but he will not be welcome under the Ukip banner.Mr Banks added: "The vast majority of Ukip people are lovely people but there is an element that causes trouble and if I was in charge I would want to eliminate all of that." in last year's referendum, as fertile ground for a challenge to Labour in a contest triggered by the resignation of former shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. However, Mr Nuttall's gamble of standing himself failed to come off as Labour's Gareth Snell held the seat with a majority of 2,620, raising questions as to whether Ukip could take seats from Labour in its traditional heartlands.In response, Mr Farage appeared to suggest Ukip should adopt Donald Trump-style immigration policies to "own" the issue in the eyes of the electorate.He said on Friday: "Should we have strong vetting, should we make sure that we're a place that illegal immigrants can't come, should we have a proper, balanced, system where we take good people in from around the world?"Absolutely, that's exactly what we should be doing and I think maybe Ukip has slightly lost ownership of this argument."Film maker Stacey Dooley was held by Japanese police for two hours during a visit to the country for a new documentary investigating child sexual exploitation.Ms Dooley was quizzed by officers after the film crew shot footage of two schoolgirls walking on a Tokyo street where men can rent teenagers to provide them with company, hold hands or fall asleep in their laps.During the making of the BBC Three film, two men object to the cameras, telling the television presenter "no movies" and demanding the crew erase footage.Ms Dooley tells the men "we are not going to erase any footage because we haven't broken the law in any way," as an argument ensues before police arrive and intervene.Speaking to the camera after being held, she says: "So I've just been kept by the police for the past two hours, they held us against our will, they would not let us go."Those grown men they intimidated me, I'm nearly 30 years old, a strong woman, so if they do have a relationship with these girls, you know they looked certainly under 18 some of them."I'm sure they're quite impressionable, they'd be very easy to manipulate, and if they asked them to do something they didn't want to do, I don't know how confident they'd feel to say no."Speaking about the film, Ms Dooley said: "Our documentary on Japan essentially focuses on the fact that they (Japanese government) only made it illegal to possess child pornography in 2014."We set out to try and understand why it took a privileged country, like Japan, so long to come to this conclusion and also to see if the change in their law had made any real difference on the ground."However those brands parent company Whirlpool has always maintained the affected models are safe so long as they are not left unattended when in use.Im pleased to say sense has prevailed and Whirlpool are now advising: Switch the machines off and do not use them until they have been repaired/modified.For some this message has come far too late and for others still waiting for a repair/modification it does nothing to ease their misery.It is vitally important that you follow Whirlpools instructions and switch the dryer off and stop using it. If you dont and your machine catches fire, your house insurer will almost certainly refuse to pay out.Whirlpool are being slow with repairs but Ive heard consumers have got their repair/modification quickly after shouting louder and turning to social media.Even though this is a manufacturers issue, your contract is with the retailer who sold the machine to you. This means they have an obligation to deal with the issue.The law (Sale of Goods Act 1979 for purchases before 1st October 2015 and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 for purchases thereafter) provides that faulty goods must be rectified within a reasonable amount of time, failing which they should be replaced.If you purchased your machine using your credit card, go to your provider and say that you want to make a section 75 claim. This is a claim under the Consumer Credit Act that you can make when you buy goods with the card (for more than 100) and the trader refuses or fails to act on a problem.Whirlpool need to stop thinking about their profits and start putting safety first. These dodgy dyers should now be subject to a Product Recall and consumers reimbursed or provided with replacement machines immediately. have resigned themselves to losing the talented defender, who is out of contract at the end of next season and shows no interest in extending his stay.
