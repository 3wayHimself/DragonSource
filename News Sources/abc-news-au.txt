Moscow is being forced to readjust its expectations of a closer relationship with the US just four months after Donald Trump was elected President.There had been celebrations in Russia at the thought of a White House that did not involve Hillary Clinton, with hopes it would end years of fractious diplomacy.Donald Trump was given blanket coverage on state media and souvenir matryoshka dolls (at $AU45) and coffee mugs (slightly less at $10) imprinted with Mr Trump's face were snapped up by Russians and tourists.Andrey Kortunov, director of Moscow-based think tank the Russian International Affairs Council, said it was too early to make final judgements but there were "a lot of emotions, including anxiety" in Moscow.The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's Upper House said there was a "paranoia" and "Russiophobia" brewing in the US."I determined the reaction of the American establishment as paranoia, as Russophobia, as an attempt to set down red flags around Mr Trump and other members of his team in order to limit their ambition to start up some kind of dialogue with Russia," he said.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was too early to suggest Moscow was disappointed at the turn of events.The head of the Russia program at Chatham House in London, James Nixey, said it was clear Russians were not necessarily "jumping down the aisles" about Mr Trump's victory anymore."If he's unpredictable to you and me then he's of course unpredictable to the Kremlin as well," he said."He's a sensitive man and doesn't take criticism very well. And when you have two strongmen and two super powers rubbing up against each other then a few tweets are not the basis for a relationship."And the tabloid newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda was derogatory of Mr Trump after his recent lengthy press conference.Its headline declared: "As the saying goes, you need to be drunk to understand the true position of America's President".Ms Zakharova would not say if the Trump administration's mixed messages were proving to be difficult to understand."We were managing with Washington and latest years showed us and the world that Washington and the previous administration was absolutely unpredictable.""We definitely have some expectations left, we are optimistic that relations between the United States of America and Russia deserve better conditions," he said.The White House has said it wants a de-escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine and for Russia to give back Crimea.Diplomats told the ABC it would be highly unlikely for Mr Trump to hold a bilateral meeting with Mr Putin before similar meetings with German and French presidents.From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.Muhammad Ali's son, who bears the boxing great's name, was detained by immigration officials at a Florida airport and questioned about his ancestry and religion in what amounted to profiling, a family friend has said.Returning from a Black History Month event in Jamaica, Muhammad Ali Jr and his mother, Khalilah Camacho Ali, were pulled aside and separated from each other while going through the immigration checkpoint on February 7 at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, said Chris Mancini, a family friend and attorney.Ms Ali was released a short time later after showing a photo of herself with her ex-husband, the former heavyweight boxing champion, Mr Mancini said.But Mr Ali Jr was not carrying a photo of his world-famous father, who was a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Mr Ali Jr, 44, who confirmed his Muslim faith, was detained for about two hours, despite telling officials that he is Ali's son and a native-born US citizen, Mr Mancini said.It was the first time Mr Ali Jr and his mother have ever been asked if they are Muslim when re-entering the US, Mr Mancini said."From the way they were treated, from what was said to them, they can come up with no other rational explanation except they fell into a profiling program run by customs, which is designed to obtain information from anyone who says they're a Muslim," Mr Mancini said. US Customs and Border Protection released a statement on Friday saying it could not discuss individual travellers, but did speak more broadly about inspections. "All international travellers arriving in the US are subject to CBP inspection," The Courier-Journal's report about the detention said.She said she felt like she had been "physically assaulted" and "sobbed like a baby" in her hotel room after the questioning.During his detention, Mr Ali Jr was repeatedly asked about his lineage and his name, "as if that was a pre-programmed question that was part of a profile," Mr Mancini said.Mr Ali Jr and his mother have been frequent global travellers. The family connects their treatment to President Donald Trump's efforts to restrict immigration after calling during his campaign for a ban on Muslims entering the US."They're asked specifically about their Arabic names. Where they got their names from and whether they're Muslims. It doesn't take much to connect those dots to what Trump is doing."Ms Ali and Mr Ali Jr live in Florida. They have not travelled abroad since, and are considering filing a federal lawsuit, Mr Mancini said.People lined the streets of Louisville, Kentucky, to say goodbye to the city's most celebrated son before a star-studded memorial service watched worldwide.Meanwhile, US immigration authorities are barring entry to a 21-year-old Syrian cinematographer who worked on a harrowing film about his nation's civil war, The White Helmets, which has been nominated for an Academy Award.According to internal Trump administration correspondence,  the Department of Homeland Security decided at the last minute to block Khaled Khateeb from traveling to Los Angeles for the Oscars.Mr Khateeb was scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on Saturday, travelling on a Turkish Airlines flight departing from Istanbul.But his plans have been upended after US officials reported finding "derogatory information" regarding Mr Khateeb.Derogatory information is a broad category that can include anything from terror connections to passport irregularities.Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, Gillian Christensen, said, "a valid travel document is required for travel to the United States".From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.Australia rugby union international James O'Connor has been arrested in Paris on suspicion of attempting to buy cocaine.O'Connor, who plays for French club Toulon, and New Zealand rugby union international Ali Williams were arrested on Saturday morning (local time) near a nightclub in the 16th district of Paris.O'Connor and Williams were both drunk at the time of their arrest and were not carrying identification.Williams's French club Racing 92 released a statement saying the 77-Test All Black had been suspended over the incident.O'Connor, who has played 44 Tests for the Wallabies as a utility back, moved to Toulon in the 2015/16 French Top 14 season after being released from a two-year contract with Queensland Reds.He had previously played for Toulon prior to joining the Reds at the beginning of 2015 when he was pushing for selection in the Wallabies' World Cup squad.The 26-year-old's career has been marred by off-field incidents, including when he was granted an early release from his Australian Rugby Union contract in 2013.From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.Some of the worst environmental pollution in the world has been discovered among the World Heritage-listed Blue Mountains, according to researchers from Western Sydney University.For several years, environmental science lecturer Ian Wright and his team has been studying the effect of the Clarence Colliery on the Wollangambe River, which runs deep within the Wollemi National Park.Since the 1980s the operators of the underground coal mine, Centennial Coal, have been allowed to discharge mine waste into the river under its environmental licence.Dr Wright said they discovered pollution not just at the discharge point, but 22 kilometres downstream, right in the heart of the World Heritage-listed area."This is big on an international basis, this could be one of the most polluting coal mines in the world," he said."One of the reasons we make that statement is because it's so clean here. It's looking at the stain of pollution on a very clean background."This is unusual because it's happening in area that's so clean. Any disturbance stands out like a bright beacon.The team discovered high levels of salt and metals like nickel and zinc when they compared the river downstream of the discharge point to tributaries and waterways located metres away, as well as the river above the discharge point. "The salinity level increases 10 times from background (other waterways) due to the mine drainage but we also get things like zinc and nickel, metallic elements at unnaturally high levels than you don't see in the background," he said."But the levels raised 9,300 per cent in some cases and the level is 10 times above that recommended in the water quality guidelines protecting ecosystems.""The numbers of insects of any type whatsoever drops by about 90 per cent downstream. We do get some recovery but still way below the natural background, that's upstream and in the tributaries.""We had hours where we would only find one or two animals, and they are the species that are really tolerant."The new study prompted swift action from the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), who changed the operating licence.EPA regional director for south and west Gary Whytcross said they reduced the amount of metals and salt that could be in the discharge water."The science is very clear, there are impacts there, we need to make changes and that's why we're going to be tightening the licence," Mr Whytcross said.He said the EPA had been working with the company, along with Dr Wright and other community groups to address the issue."[We are] tightening limits comparable with the World Heritage area that this creek is in so that the water quality can improve and the critters can come back and be healthy," he said.The mine has been a major employer for the local community in Lithgow for nearly four decades, currently employing hundreds of people."We talk about one permanent job in the coal mining industry, it had a flow-on effect of up to four and a half to five jobs that flowed on from that," he said."It's a mine that's always taken its environmental responsibilities very carefully and very importantly," he said."I entered the industry in 1975 and I must say the environmental checks and balances now are a lot more stringent on what they were then and they needed to be."A spokeswoman for Centennial Coal, Katie Brassil, said the EPA was currently finalising the five-year review of its Environmental Protection Licence (EPL)."This process included extensive aquatic ecology, ecotoxicology and macroinvertebrate investigations and monitoring in consultation with the EPA, Office of Environment and Heritage, and community stakeholders including Dr Ian Wright," she said."As a result of this review Clarence will operate under a new EPL, which will include agreed reductions in metal concentration limits for all water discharged to the Wollangambe."Clarence will also be required to comply with a Pollution Reduction Programme (PRP), also to be issued by the EPA, which will result in Centennial formalising options to address all water quality issues and to meet specific water quality milestones."Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said the Government had been briefed on Dr Wright's report."While regulation of the Clarence Colliery is primarily the responsibility of the NSW Government, the Federal Department of Environment and Energy will continue to work with the NSW Government in relation to Colliery's compliance."From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.United States President Donald Trump has said he will not attend the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, a high-profile event that draws celebrities, politicians and journalists.His announcement came a day after the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) president Jeff Mason said they were "protesting strongly" against the White House's decision to exclude several major news outlets from an informal press briefing.Every sitting president since 1924 has attended the dinner at least once, according to The New York Times.Some news outlets such as Bloomberg News and The New Yorker, which typically host lavish after-parties, have said they are backing out this year.In a statement following Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Mason said the organisation "looks forward to having its annual dinner on April 29".Mr Mason called the dinner "a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic".Critics say the event, which usually features a humorous speech by the sitting president, encourages journalists to cosy up to politicians they should cover aggressively., joking that the mogul, who sat stone-faced in the audience, would move on from questioning Mr Obama's citizenship to figuring out "did we fake the moon landing"."You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald?" Mr Obama joked."What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump steak? Tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What's he doing?"The fun did not stop there. Mr Obama allowed himself several more jabs at the real estate mogul, before eventually concluding "that's probably enough"."They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But, in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world  Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan," he quipped."And there's one area where Donald's experience could be invaluable and that in closing Guantanamo, because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground."From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people."Everything stops functioning. You'll slowly stop moving, you'll stop talking, your body functions won't function so you end up like a vegetable."The stroke was the final catastrophic event that ended months of seizures and years of health problems.It would taken even more time and a team of researchers at Yale Medical School before doctors discovered what was making Sofia so sick.The official diagnosis is: Combined Cobalamin C Defect with Methylmalonic Aciduria and Homocystinuria.But really it is a fancy name for saying Ms Belmonte's body cannot turn vitamin B12 in food into its active form in the body.She needs about three vitamin B-12 injections each week to stop amino acids building up in her body and causing another stroke.Now the Federal Government has added to that bill by removing subsidies for her Vitamin B12 injections from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).It was part of a push to stop people spending more on medications by prescription that were actually Despite representations from her doctors, the PBS would not make an exception for people with medical need.Dr Kaustuv Bhattacharya said he and metabolic doctors from the Australian Society of Inborn Errors of Metabolism wrote to the PBS stating it was imperative B12 injections were funded.There are others with conditions similar, but not the same, as Ms Belmonte who also need regular injections."We informed the PBS that our patients required these injections as part of treatment for their rare genetic condition," Dr Bhattacharya said."Untreated, these patients can become blind, be institutionalised, have intellectual deficit, having severe and permanent brain injury, paralysis and even death."In this case, as in several others, the PBS has not listened to specialist advice for therapeutic interventions from experts in rare diseases.""But now I have to pay $140 to get it made by a special chemist because what's on the shelf isn't exact enough to make my body function.""For rare people like me and for people that have cancers or have dementia or have broad spectrum diseases, they should get their medicines on the PBS," she said.Rare Voices Australia executive officer Nicole Millis said people like Ms Belmonte often fell victim to a health system that did not cater to them in areas that ranged from diagnostics to medications."The health system is not geared to respond to rare disease, it's geared towards diseases with larger patient cohorts."There's very few treatments for rare disease and often when there is a treatment developed it can be quite expensive and it can be difficult for patients to access it without government support."In this case, government doesn't understand the importance of the medicines and just with a blanket policy change rare disease is discriminated against."In a statement, the Federal Health Department said the legislation governing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme did not allow exceptions for individuals."When purchased without a prescription, the cost for a box of three vitamin B12 injections should be very similar to the PBS concessional co-payment of $6.30," the statement read.Four decades since her stroke, Ms Belmonte still suffers some of the side-effects from the stroke and has a range of symptoms related to her rare condition."If the levels become unbalanced it can take you back so you're in the shell of a body

remote Northern Territory town of Tennant Creek are calling on the NT or federal governments to offer their children health checks to determine whether they are suffering from asbestos exposure.For years the children unknowingly played in a vandalised building containing asbestos purchased by the town's largest Aboriginal corporation with Commonwealth money.Julalikari Council Aboriginal Corporation bought the building eight years ago with part of a $1.2 million Federal Government grant for community centres and housing.Residents now want answers about why the government didn't ensure Julalikari put the building into use, which they feel would have prevented it being vandalised and broken apart by children."Because the structure was all smashed up into tiny bits, as you can see those bits on the ground, kids were playing in here for months and months using it as a cubby house," resident Linda Turner said.Christine Morton lives with her extended family across the road from the building, and says she is very worried that asbestos effects may show up in her grandchildren years later."We'd like for government to come and talk to us, and what all the dangers are for us and especially for those kids that were playing in those buildings," she said.Christine Grant, who also lives nearby, says she wants her children to be tested for asbestos effects, "to give them a check up, to see how they feel, whether they're alright or not".The same demountable buildings sit unused on six other Tennant Creek sites, and the asbestos in them was revealed in November when residents commissioned their own laboratory tests.The NT Government's Worksafe authority only confirmed the asbestos was present this month, after more tests were carried out by the Asbestos Disease Support Society."I personally was disappointed in Worksafe and I thought their response was tardy," said Tennant Creek businessman Richard Dodd.Julalikari has released a statement saying when the units were imported, "the importer assured the corporation that they didn't contain asbestos".The corporation says now that its own tests have confirmed asbestos, and that it is working with NT Worksafe to put in a series of risk control measures to protect the public and workers, including fencing off all the units.The buildings were imported from China for Julalikari by former AFL star Neville Roberts' company Rehne.In January 2016 he told the ABC: "They were recreational houses for the Julalikari Corporation down there. They're staff houses and houses for transitional children and transitional Indigenous travelling around."Australian asbestos imports were banned in 2003; the Immigration Department hasn't explained why it allowed the buildings into Australia but says it is "further scrutinising the importer"."It's definitely a massive failure on behalf of Border Force, and obviously the government of the day and the ministers of the day because it shouldn't be coming in," said Andrew Ramsay from the Asbestos Disease Support Society.The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has been investigating Julalikari's compliance with funding agreements, including for the demountable buildings, for three years.It has given Julalikari until March to respond to the results of its investigation, which it has refused to publish."People are disappointed the government don't seem to react to what is a large community concern for years," Richard Dodd said.The Federal Indigenous corporations watchdog ORIC moved on Julalikari this week, putting it into administration for six months, saying its ability to respond to governance and operational matters had been compromised by community disputes.Julalikari has hit back, saying it "provided ORIC with a comprehensive response that addressed all of its concerns, and made a compelling case against the need to appoint a special administrator".In it Julalikari has particularly rejected the "most serious findings (of impropriety and lack of due care and diligence)" as being "baseless".The Corporation has outright rejected some findings, including that a majority of its directors were employees."Presently five of Julalikari's directors are employees of the corporation.  the Act  is breached if seven or more directors are also employees."Julalikari said other findings, including that it had "failed to properly monitor and manage" the remote jobs Community Development Program, had been resolved."PM&C did raise concerns to the corporation with respect to the delivery of the CDP program in 2015 and early 2016  all concerns were met and finalised and the corporation's performance is now consistently sound."Julalikari said the finding that "insufficient staff were engaged to deliver certain programs and this was contributing to poor program outcomes in some" is "an issue which has been rectified".It accepted some findings, including that not all of its directors are from Corporation member communities, and that "all cheques, withdrawal forms and other banking documents are not signed by at least two directors"."It is from a pragmatic perspective anomalous that directors must approve each individual transaction on a case-by-case basis."Julalikari also accused ORIC of listening too enthusiastically to criticisms from Tennant Creek people, including service station owner Richard Dodd, who is involved in a dispute with the Corporation over their joint business partnership."I don't blame any one particular body of government, I think the whole lot of them should have got off their backsides and done something a hell of a lot earlier than this," Andrew Ramsay said.Resident Christine Morton says the government action against Julalikari is too late to make much difference to people who now have a horrible wait to see whether they will suffer asbestos effects."Ever since I heard about it, I can't stop thinking about it. All the time, especially for the kids," she said.From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.Australia captain Steve Smith is hoping a lack of scar tissue in the current Test side will help it capitalise on the stunning success in Pune. continued a resurgence for the team but also Smith, who said the win was one of the best he had been a part of during his Test career.Leading a relatively young squad, it was two of the side's least-experienced campaigners who were the chief destroyers.Steve O'Keefe's staggering 12-wicket performance and opener Matt Renshaw's gutsy displays belied their combined 10 Tests of experience.But Smith suggested that fresh perspective was a boon to an Australian side riding high after the first win on Indian soil since 2004.Of the current Australia XI, only Smith, David Warner, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon were around for the calamitous 2013 tour."The fact that we had some younger players here who haven't experienced here before  no scars  they were able to go out and just play the game," he told Grandstand."He played really well, and to score 60 and 30 in his first game on that wicket at the age of [20] is an incredible achievement."Hopefully we can see more improvement from the guys going forward, but [I'm] really proud of that performance."Bizarrely, some of the current crop will only have happy memories of playing in India, which is even more unbelievable considering the pitch on which they thrived.The curator offered up what Smith called the "driest ... most inconsistent spinning surface I've ever seen".Those sort of rank turners are supposed to be kryptonite for Australia's batsmen and bowlers, but it was the tourists who looked at home."But to know that we can play the way we can and outplay them so convincingly in these conditions, it's very pleasing."From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.The resignations of the Victorian Speaker and Deputy Speaker over the "appalling" abuse of parliamentary entitlements is the "right decision" and changes will be made to ensure the rules are black and white, Premier Daniel Andrews says. Mr Andrews said he spoke to the Speaker, Telmo Languiller, and Deputy Speaker Don Nardella on Saturday to tell them their positions were untenable and they should resign.Mr Languiller, the Labor member for Tarneit, and Mr Nardella, the MP for Melton, resigned after it was revealed both men who represent seats in the western suburbs had claimed an allowance intended for country MPs."Is it any wonder there is a cynicism, a scepticism that there is a distrust of so many members of Parliament when we see behaviour  appalling behaviour like this?" Mr Andrews said.The Special Minister of State, Gavan Jennings, was tasked with the job of examining the second residence allowance and whether or not there were any other allowances that would not meet community expectations."Essentially I've asked the Special Minister of State to give me advice on changing the rules so that this can never happen again and that the rules, as we look to the future, are black and white," he said.Under parliamentary rules, politicians are entitled to the "second residence" allowance if their home base is at least 80km from Melbourne's CBD and they keep a second property in the city.  Mr Languiller, who told Parliament he moved to Queenscliff, 80 kilometres from Melbourne because of "complex family reasons", However in a statement on Saturday, Mr Languiller said he recognised that offering to repay the money was not enough and that he accepted he should "pay for that error of judgement".Mr Nardella said he had responded to a media question about his primary and secondary residence and associated parliamentary allowances.Liberal MP Tim Smith welcomed the resignations but said Mr Nardella should be forced to repay the money he claimed.   "The Premier's statement was silent on the money... the $100,000 he's collected since April 2014 that he should never have received," he said.  Mr Andrews said he would leave the decision of repayment up to the Audit Committee of Parliament, which was examining the matter, to decide.From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.A monthly Darwin clinic is helping transgender people previously overlooked by the Northern Territory's health system, yet its long-term future is uncertain due to funding concerns.Father and husband Evo Koulakis is one of an unidentified number of transgender Territorians who have had to navigate the Top End's health system.His transition from female to male three years ago means he has specialist needs such as testosterone replacement therapy; these are difficult to access outside major capital cities like Sydney and Melbourne."I left there feeling low, quite sad about the situation. It highlighted what a bad state we're in in Darwin when it comes to transgender health and that there really is nobody."I refused to go back to him to get blood tests with him. That's how awful that made me feel about the process."It is a familiar story for general practitioner Dr Danielle Stewart, who returned to Darwin last year after a stint at a Melbourne health clinic for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) people."It was a wonderful experience working there and I realised the sense of community that it gave and a sense of trust for people coming to the clinic," Dr Stewart said.By comparison, Dr Stewart said in Darwin many were "patching together" their treatment in a fractured health system or sourcing hormones online and "self-treating".Others such as teenager Benji Rabeling were battling suicidal thoughts and a lack of options, eventually deciding to In mid-2016 Dr Stewart decided to launch a one-day-a-month health clinic for LGBTQI people out of her general practice in Darwin's leafy northern suburbs.A specialist was flown from interstate with funding from the NT AIDS and Hepatitis Council (NTAHC), yet Dr Stewart had no idea if anybody would show up for the clinic's first day.This was largely because, until recently, the NT Health Department did not take data on the prevalence of gender diversity in its population."We didn't know how many we'd get at the clinic. We thought we'd just give it a go," Dr Stewart said.While Dr Stewart launched the clinic for all LGBTQI people, its core patient makeup is now 90 per cent transgender or gender diverse.She said this challenged comments last year by the former CLP health minister John Elferink that there was not enough demand for transgender-specific health services in the Territory."It's a case of that you don't know that there's people out there until they're allowed to be out there," Dr Stewart said.This year Dr Stewart's practice has been covering the expenses of flying up and accommodating interstate specialists, with most clients bulk-billed as part of a commitment to accessible health care.General practice and mental health funding generally lies with the Federal Government's Primary Healthcare Network (PHN), with specialist and hospital-based services funded by state governments.A recent baseline assessment by the NT arm of PHN identified there was a need for specialist LGBTQI services in the Territory, with funding likely to be allocated to providers in 2017.Dr Stewart added the NT Labor Government's newly formed working party to create a LGBTQI-specific policy framework was also promising.After committing to collecting data on gender diverse Territorians, Health Minister Natasha Fyles said discussions about funding services would have to wait until more was known."It's a challenge around understanding what need there is and obviously in terms of the primary health care that fits with the Federal Government," she said."We have to remember that we're a relatively small population and isolated. So it's a real balance between providing these services and making sure health outcomes are equally met."Now a Northside Health client, he has been able to get blood tests instead of avoiding specialists, however the service has emerged as something more as well."I told Dr Stewart recently that it was my three-year anniversary of being on testosterone. That brought a tear to her eye. She really does care," he said."Without her, I'd have a lot of anxiety about not knowing how I'd be treated. I'd be wondering if [the doctor] would be professional enough to put things aside and treat me like a real person."From the outside it appears Moscow has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade, but Lisa Millar experiences first hand how the city is paralysed by trafficThe only Australian tall ship to sail in the 1988 First Fleet re-enactment voyage for Australia's bicentenary celebrates 30 years on the water.Cambodia's Khmer Rouge tribunal this week dropped its case against a suspect accused of killing thousands of people.
